344.Reverse String
Explanation:

The provided code defines a class `Solution` with a method `reverseString` that takes a list of characters `s` and reverses it in place. Here's a breakdown of how the method works:

1. **Looping Through the First Half**:
   The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(s) // 2 - 1`. This is because the list only needs to be traversed halfway to swap all elements.

2. **Swapping Elements**:
   Inside the loop, elements at positions `i` and `~i` are swapped. The expression `~i` is a bitwise complement operator, which is equivalent to `-(i+1)`. So, `s[~i]` is the element at position `-(i+1)`, which is the corresponding element from the end of the list.

Here's the code with added comments for clarity:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        # Loop through the first half of the list
        for i in range(len(s) // 2):
            # Swap the element at index i with the element at index ~i (-(i+1))
            s[i], s[~i] = s[~i], s[i]
```

### Example Usage

Let's see how this works with an example:

```python
s = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
Solution().reverseString(s)
print(s)  # Output: ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
```

**Explanation**:
- `i = 0`: Swap `s[0]` and `s[-1]` -> `["o", "e", "l", "l", "h"]`
- `i = 1`: Swap `s[1]` and `s[-2]` -> `["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]`

The loop ends after `i = 1` because the list has been traversed halfway.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the list. This is because each element is visited and swapped once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) because the list is modified in place without using extra space.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        for i in range(len(s)//2):
            s[i], s[~i] = s[~i], s[i]
