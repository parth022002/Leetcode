2597.The Number of Beautiful Subsets
Explanation:

To solve the problem of counting "beautiful subsets" of the list `nums` where no two elements differ by `k`, we need to use a backtracking approach. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation and the code provided:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Definition of Beautiful Subset**:
   - A subset of `nums` is called beautiful if for any two elements `a` and `b` in the subset, the absolute difference `|a - b|` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - We need to generate all possible subsets of `nums` and check each subset to see if it satisfies the condition of being beautiful.
   - Using backtracking, we can systematically explore all subsets by including or excluding each element, while checking the condition on the fly.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - Sorting `nums` can make the check more efficient and systematic as we can consider elements in an increasing order, helping to avoid redundant checks.

### Code Explanation

The provided solution uses a backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets and count those that are beautiful:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to zero to keep track of the number of beautiful subsets.
   - `nums.sort()` is used to sort the list.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - `backtrack(start, current_subset)` is a recursive function.
   - `start` keeps track of the current position in `nums` from where we are considering elements.
   - `current_subset` is the current subset being built.

3. **Backtracking Logic**:
   - If `current_subset` is non-empty, increment the `count` since any non-empty subset is considered for counting.
   - Iterate over the remaining elements in `nums` starting from `start`.
   - For each element, check if it can be added to `current_subset` without violating the beautiful subset condition.
   - If it can be added, include it in `current_subset`, recursively call `backtrack` to proceed with the next element, and then backtrack by removing the last added element.

4. **Check Condition**:
   - The condition `abs(num - nums[i]) == k` is checked for every element already in `current_subset`.

### Code Implementation

Here's the implementation with detailed comments:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def beautifulSubsets(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def backtrack(start, current_subset):
            nonlocal count
            
            # Only count non-empty subsets
            if current_subset:
                count += 1
            
            for i in range(start, len(nums)):
                # Check if current element nums[i] can be added to the current_subset
                can_add = True
                for num in current_subset:
                    if abs(num - nums[i]) == k:
                        can_add = False
                        break
                        
                if can_add:
                    # Include nums[i] in the subset and proceed
                    current_subset.append(nums[i])
                    backtrack(i + 1, current_subset)
                    # Backtrack: remove the last added element
                    current_subset.pop()
        
        nums.sort()  # Sorting to make the checking more efficient
        count = 0
        backtrack(0, [])
        return count
```

### Example Usage

Let's test the solution with an example:

```python
sol = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
k = 1
print(sol.beautifulSubsets(nums, k))  # Output: 8
```

The given code will recursively generate and count all subsets of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` that do not have any two elements differing by `1`. The final count of such subsets is returned.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def beautifulSubsets(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def backtrack(start, current_subset):
            nonlocal count
            
            # Only count non-empty subsets
            if current_subset:
                count += 1
            
            for i in range(start, len(nums)):
                # Check if current element nums[i] can be added to the current_subset
                can_add = True
                for num in current_subset:
                    if abs(num - nums[i]) == k:
                        can_add = False
                        break
                        
                if can_add:
                    # Include nums[i] in the subset and proceed
                    current_subset.append(nums[i])
                    backtrack(i + 1, current_subset)
                    # Backtrack: remove the last added element
                    current_subset.pop()
        
        nums.sort()  # Sorting to make the checking more efficient
        count = 0
        backtrack(0, [])
        return count
