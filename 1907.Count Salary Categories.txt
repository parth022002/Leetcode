1907.Count Salary Categories
Explaination:

This MySQL query provides a breakdown of account categories based on income ranges. It uses three separate subqueries within each SELECT statement to count the number of accounts falling into each category.

Here's the breakdown:

```sql
(SELECT 
    "Low Salary" AS category,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Accounts WHERE income < 20000) AS accounts_count)
```
- This part selects the category "Low Salary" and counts the number of accounts where the income is less than 20000.

```sql
UNION ALL
```
- This keyword combines the results of the first SELECT statement with the subsequent ones.

```sql
(SELECT 
    "Average Salary" AS category,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Accounts WHERE income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000) AS accounts_count)
```
- This part selects the category "Average Salary" and counts the number of accounts where the income is between 20000 and 50000.

```sql
UNION ALL
```
- This keyword combines the results of the previous SELECT statements with the subsequent one.

```sql
(SELECT 
    "High Salary" AS category,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Accounts WHERE income > 50000) AS accounts_count)
```
- This part selects the category "High Salary" and counts the number of accounts where the income is greater than 50000.

This query will provide a result set with three rows, each representing a different income category ("Low Salary", "Average Salary", and "High Salary") along with the count of accounts falling into each category.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
(select 
"Low Salary" as category,

union all
(select 
"Average Salary" as category,
(select count(*) from Accounts where income >= 20000 and income <= 50000) as accounts_count)
union all 
(select 
"High Salary" as category,
(select count(*) from Accounts where income > 50000) as accounts_count)
