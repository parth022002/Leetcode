200.Number of Islands
Explanation:

It looks like you have implemented a solution to the classic "Number of Islands" problem using depth-first search (DFS). This algorithm traverses the grid, marking visited land cells and recursively exploring adjacent land cells to form islands.

Here's how the code works:

- The `numIslands` function takes a 2D grid of characters as input and returns the number of islands in the grid.
- It initializes the `num_islands` variable to count the number of islands.
- It defines a nested function `dfs` which performs a depth-first search to explore all connected land cells of an island starting from a given cell `(i, j)`.
- Within the `dfs` function, it marks the current cell as visited by changing its value to `'0'`, and then recursively calls `dfs` on its neighboring land cells (up, down, left, and right).
- In the main function, it iterates through each cell of the grid. When it encounters a land cell (`'1'`), it increments the `num_islands` counter and starts DFS from that cell.
- Finally, it returns the total number of islands found.

Overall, the algorithm has a time complexity of O(M*N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid, since each cell is visited exactly once.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '1':
                return
            grid[i][j] = '0'  # mark as visited
            dfs(i+1, j)
            dfs(i-1, j)
            dfs(i, j+1)
            dfs(i, j-1)
        
        num_islands = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    num_islands += 1
                    dfs(i, j)
        
        return num_islands
