185.Department Top Three Salaries
Explaination:

The provided MySQL query aims to retrieve the top three employees with the highest salary in each department. It employs the `DENSE_RANK()` window function to assign ranks to employees within each department based on their salaries. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Inner Query (Subquery)**:
   - It selects the department name (`d.name`), employee name (`e.name`), employee salary (`e.salary`), and assigns a rank (`rnk`) to each employee within their respective department.
   - The `DENSE_RANK()` function is used to rank employees based on their salary in descending order within each department.

```sql
SELECT 
    d.name AS Department,
    e.name AS Employee,
    e.salary AS Salary,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
```

2. **Outer Query**:
   - It selects the department name (`Department`), employee name (`Employee`), and salary (`Salary`) from the results of the inner query.
   - It filters the results to include only those employees with a rank (`rnk`) less than or equal to 3, meaning the top three employees in each department based on salary.

```sql
SELECT Department, Employee, Salary
FROM (
    -- Inner Query (Subquery) here
) AS rnk_tbl
WHERE rnk <= 3;
```

This query will provide a list of the top three employees with the highest salary in each department.

Solution:

#Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Department, Employee, Salary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        d.name AS Department,
        e.name AS Employee,
        e.salary AS Salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN Department d
    ON e.departmentId = d.id
) AS rnk_tbl
WHERE rnk <= 3;
