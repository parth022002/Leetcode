861.Score After Flipping Matrix
Explanation:

It appears you've implemented a solution for a problem related to maximizing the score of a binary matrix by toggling rows and columns. Your code calculates the maximum score achievable by flipping rows and columns of the given binary matrix.

Here's a breakdown of your code:

1. The `matrixScore` method takes a 2D grid (list of lists) of integers representing a binary matrix and returns an integer representing the maximum score achievable.

2. It initializes variables `n` and `m` to store the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

3. It initializes the variable `res` to store the result, starting with the score obtained by setting the leftmost bit of each row to 1 (since flipping rows will always increase the score). This is achieved by `(1 << (m - 1)) * n`, where `<<` is the left shift operator.

4. It iterates over each column index `j` (except the first column) from 1 to `m - 1`.

5. For each column, it calculates the value `val` as `1 << (m - 1 - j)`, which corresponds to the contribution of flipping the current column to the score.

6. It initializes `set_count` to count the number of rows that have the same value in the current column as in the first column.

7. It iterates over each row index `i` and increments `set_count` if the value in the current column matches the value in the first column for that row.

8. After iterating over all rows, it calculates the maximum score contribution for flipping the current column by taking the maximum of `set_count` and `n - set_count` (the number of rows minus `set_count`).

9. It updates `res` by adding the score contribution for the current column (`max(set_count, n - set_count) * val`).

10. After iterating over all columns, it returns the final result stored in `res`.

Your implementation seems correct for the problem of maximizing the score of a binary matrix. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

Solution:

class Solution:
    def matrixScore(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        res = (1 << (m - 1)) * n

        for j in range(1, m):
            val = 1 << (m - 1 - j)
            set_count = 0

            for i in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == grid[i][0]:
                    set_count += 1

            res += max(set_count, n - set_count) * val

        return res
