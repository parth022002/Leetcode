143.Reorder List
Explaination:

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `reorderList` to reorder a singly-linked list in place. The function reorders the list such that nodes from the second half are inserted alternatively between the nodes of the first half.

Here's how the code works:

1. It first checks if the given linked list is empty or contains only one node. If so, it returns without any modification as there is no need to reorder.

2. Then, it finds the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer points to the middle of the list.

3. It splits the linked list into two halves. The first half remains unchanged, while the second half starts from the node next to the middle node.

4. The code then reverses the second half of the linked list. This is achieved by iteratively reversing the next pointers of the nodes in the second half.

5. Finally, it merges the first half and the reversed second half alternately by adjusting the next pointers. This is done by taking nodes from both halves alternately and updating their next pointers.

This algorithm ensures that the reordered list has nodes alternatively from the first half and the reversed second half.

The code does not explicitly return anything because it modifies the given linked list in place as per the problem's requirement.
