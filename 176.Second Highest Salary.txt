176.Second Highest Salary
Explaination:

This MySQL query retrieves the second-highest salary from the `Employee` table. It utilizes a subquery to select the distinct salaries, orders them in descending order, skips the first one using the `OFFSET` clause, and then selects the first salary after the offset. The `IFNULL` function is used to handle cases where there might not be a second-highest salary.

Here's the breakdown:

```sql
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
       LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
```

- The `SELECT` statement retrieves the second-highest salary and aliases it as `SecondHighestSalary`.
  
- The subquery:
  - `SELECT DISTINCT Salary` retrieves all distinct salary values from the `Employee` table.
  - `ORDER BY Salary DESC` orders the salary values in descending order.
  - `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1` skips the first row (highest salary) and selects the second row, effectively getting the second-highest salary.

- The `IFNULL` function:
  - Checks if the subquery returns `NULL`, indicating there is no second-highest salary.
  - If the subquery returns `NULL`, it returns `NULL` as the `SecondHighestSalary`.

This query provides the second-highest salary from the `Employee` table, or `NULL` if there is no such value (for example, if there is only one distinct salary in the table).

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
