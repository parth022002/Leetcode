1978.Employees Whosde manager Left the Company
Explaination:

This MySQL query selects the `employee_id` of employees who have a salary less than 30000 and whose manager is not found in the Employees table. Here's the breakdown:

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id
```
- This selects the `employee_id` column from the `Employees` table.

```sql
FROM Employees e1
```
- This specifies the `Employees` table and aliases it as `e1`.

```sql
WHERE e1.salary < 30000 
```
- This condition filters the rows, selecting only those employees with a salary less than 30000.

```sql
AND e1.manager_id NOT IN (
    SELECT employee_id FROM Employees
)
```
- This condition further filters the rows, excluding employees whose `manager_id` is not found in the Employees table. The subquery selects all `employee_id` from the Employees table.

```sql
ORDER BY e1.employee_id;
```
- This orders the result set by the `employee_id` column in ascending order.

Overall, this query retrieves the `employee_id` of employees with a salary less than 30000 and whose manager is not listed in the Employees table.
