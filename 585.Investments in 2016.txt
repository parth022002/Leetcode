585.Investments in 2016
Explaination:

This MySQL query calculates the total insured value for the year 2016 (`tiv_2016`) for insurance policies where the insured value for the year 2015 (`tiv_2015`) is duplicated and the location (latitude, longitude) is unique. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Main Query**:
   - It selects the rounded sum of insured values for the year 2016 (`tiv_2016`) from the `Insurance` table.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
```

2. **WHERE Clause**:
   - It filters the rows from the `Insurance` table:
     - It selects rows where the insured value for the year 2015 (`tiv_2015`) is found in a subquery that identifies duplicate values of `tiv_2015`.
     - It further filters rows where the location (latitude, longitude) is unique, as determined by a subquery that groups by latitude and longitude and checks for counts equal to 1.

```sql
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
```

This query will sum up the insured values for the year 2016 (`tiv_2016`) for insurance policies meeting the specified conditions.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
