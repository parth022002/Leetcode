592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction
Solution:

from fractions import Fraction
class Solution:
    def fractionAddition(self, expression: str) -> str:
        fractions = expression.replace('-', '+-').split('+')
        fractions = list(filter(None, fractions))  # filter out empty strings
        
        result = Fraction(0, 1)
        
        for frac in fractions:
            result += Fraction(frac)
        
        return f"{result.numerator}/{result.denominator}"

Explanation:

Let's break down the code step by step:

### 1. **Importing the `Fraction` Class**
   ```python
   from fractions import Fraction
   ```
   - The `Fraction` class from Python's `fractions` module is used to represent rational numbers as fractions. It allows for automatic simplification of fractions and easy arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. **Defining the Class and Method**
   ```python
   class Solution:
       def fractionAddition(self, expression: str) -> str:
   ```
   - We define a class `Solution` that contains the method `fractionAddition`. This method takes a string `expression` as input and returns a string representing the result of the fraction addition or subtraction.

### 3. **Splitting the Expression into Individual Fractions**
   ```python
   fractions = expression.replace('-', '+-').split('+')
   ```
   - **`expression.replace('-', '+-')`**: This replaces all occurrences of `-` with `+-`. This step is crucial because it ensures that each fraction in the expression has a preceding sign (`+` or `-`). For example, `"1/2-1/3+1/4"` becomes `"1/2+-1/3+1/4"`.
   - **`.split('+')`**: After replacing the `-` signs, the expression is split into a list of strings by the `+` sign. For instance, `"1/2+-1/3+1/4"` will split into `['1/2', '-1/3', '1/4']`.

### 4. **Filtering Out Empty Strings**
   ```python
   fractions = list(filter(None, fractions))
   ```
   - After splitting the expression, some empty strings may appear in the list due to leading or trailing `+` signs. The `filter(None, fractions)` removes these empty strings, ensuring that we only work with valid fraction strings.

### 5. **Initializing the Result as a Fraction**
   ```python
   result = Fraction(0, 1)
   ```
   - We start with a `result` initialized to `0/1`, which represents the fraction `0`.

### 6. **Adding Each Fraction to the Result**
   ```python
   for frac in fractions:
       result += Fraction(frac)
   ```
   - We iterate over each fraction string in the `fractions` list.
   - **`Fraction(frac)`**: Converts the string representation of the fraction into a `Fraction` object. For example, `'1/2'` becomes `Fraction(1, 2)`.
   - **`result += Fraction(frac)`**: Adds the current fraction to the cumulative `result`. The `Fraction` class handles the addition, including finding a common denominator and simplifying the fraction.

### 7. **Returning the Result as a String**
   ```python
   return f"{result.numerator}/{result.denominator}"
   ```
   - After processing all the fractions, the final `result` is a `Fraction` object. We extract its `numerator` and `denominator` properties and format them as a string in the form `"numerator/denominator"`.

### Example Walkthrough

- **Input:** `"-1/2+1/2"`
- **After Replacement and Splitting:** `['-1/2', '1/2']`
- **Result Calculation:**
  - Start with `0/1`.
  - Add `-1/2`: Result becomes `-1/2`.
  - Add `1/2`: Result becomes `0/1`.
- **Output:** `"0/1"`

This approach handles all the operations automatically, thanks to the `Fraction` class, ensuring that the result is simplified and returned in the correct format.
