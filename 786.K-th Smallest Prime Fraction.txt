786.K-th Smallest Prime Fraction
Explanation:

It looks like you're implementing a solution to find the kth smallest prime fraction from a sorted array `arr` of prime integers. Your approach seems to be using binary search along with some calculations to find the fraction.

Here's a brief overview of what your code is doing:

1. Initialize the left and right boundaries for binary search (`left` and `right`) to be 0 and 1 respectively.
2. While the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary, perform binary search.
3. In each iteration of the binary search:
   - Calculate the mid-point.
   - Iterate through the array to find the fractions that are less than or equal to the mid-point.
   - Count the total number of such fractions (`total`).
   - Keep track of the maximum fraction (`maxFrac`) and its numerator and denominator.
   - Adjust the boundaries of the binary search based on the value of `total`.
4. Once the binary search ends, return the maximum fraction found.

Your implementation seems correct in terms of the algorithmic approach. However, I noticed a small error in the calculation of the `mid` value. When performing division for the mid-point calculation, you should use floor division (`//`) instead of regular division (`/`) to ensure you get an integer value.

Here's the corrected line:

```python
mid = left + (right - left) // 2
```

This ensures that `mid` remains an integer, which is necessary for indexing the array.

Also, make sure to import `List` from `typing` module to fix the issue with `List[int]` in the function signature. Here's the corrected import statement:

```python
from typing import List
```

With these adjustments, your code should work correctly.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(arr)
        left, right = 0, 1
        res = []

        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2
            j, total, num, den = 1, 0, 0, 0
            maxFrac = 0
            for i in range(n):
                while j < n and arr[i] >= arr[j] * mid:
                    j += 1
                
                total += n - j

                if j < n and maxFrac < arr[i] * 1.0 / arr[j]:
                    maxFrac = arr[i] * 1.0 / arr[j]
                    num, den = i, j

            if total == k:
                res = [arr[num], arr[den]]
                break

            if total > k:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid

        return res
