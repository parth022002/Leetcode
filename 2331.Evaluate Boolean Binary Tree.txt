2331.Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree
Explanation:

It seems like you have provided a Python solution for evaluating a boolean expression represented as a binary tree. This solution defines a `Solution` class with a method `evaluateTree` which takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a boolean indicating the result of the expression.

The solution uses a recursive helper function `calc` to traverse the tree and evaluate the expression. It checks if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), in which case it returns the boolean value of the node. If the node has children, it recursively evaluates the left and right subtrees and performs the corresponding boolean operation based on the node's value (which represents the operation: `2` for OR and `3` for AND).

There's error handling included in case the input tree is not properly constructed or contains invalid node values.

Overall, it looks like a well-structured solution for evaluating boolean expression trees. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this code, feel free to ask!

Solution:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

    def evaluateTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:

            if node is None:
                raise ValueError("Node is None")  # or return False, depending on the requirement

            if node.left is None and node.right is None:

                return node.val == 1

            left = calc(node.left)
            right = calc(node.right)

            # Use a dictionary to map node values to their corresponding operations
            operations = {2: lambda l, r: l or r, 3: lambda l, r: l and r}
            if node.val not in operations:
