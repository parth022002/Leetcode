        freq_counts = Counter(word).values()
        
        # Sort frequencies in descending order
        sorted_freqs = sorted(freq_counts, reverse=True)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of pushes required
        min_pushes = sum(f * (i // 8 + 1) for i, f in enumerate(sorted_freqs))
        
        return min_pushes
        

Explanation:

Here's an explanation of the improved `minimumPushes` function step-by-step:

### Function Purpose

The purpose of the `minimumPushes` function is to calculate the minimum number of "pushes" required to type a given word on a virtual keyboard where each character push is influenced by the frequency of its occurrence and its position in sorted order.

### Code Explanation

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minimumPushes(self, word: str) -> int:
        # Count the frequency of each character in the word
        freq_counts = Counter(word).values()
        
        # Sort frequencies in descending order
        sorted_freqs = sorted(freq_counts, reverse=True)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of pushes required
        min_pushes = sum(f * (i // 8 + 1) for i, f in enumerate(sorted_freqs))
        
        return min_pushes
```

1. **Import Counter**:
    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    ```
    - Import the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the word.

2. **Class and Method Definition**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def minimumPushes(self, word: str) -> int:
    ```
    - Define a class `Solution` with a method `minimumPushes` that takes a string `word` as input.

3. **Count Character Frequencies**:
    ```python
    freq_counts = Counter(word).values()
    ```
    - Use `Counter(word).values()` to get the frequency of each character in the word. This returns a collection of frequency values.

4. **Sort Frequencies**:
    ```python
    sorted_freqs = sorted(freq_counts, reverse=True)
    ```
    - Sort these frequency values in descending order. This means the most frequent characters will come first.

5. **Calculate Minimum Pushes**:
    ```python
    min_pushes = sum(f * (i // 8 + 1) for i, f in enumerate(sorted_freqs))
    ```
    - Calculate the total number of pushes required:
        - `enumerate(sorted_freqs)` provides each frequency `f` along with its index `i`.
        - For each frequency `f`, the number of pushes is multiplied by `(i // 8 + 1)`. This formula ensures that every 8 characters (i.e., from index 0-7, 8-15, etc.) increment the push count by one. The logic behind `i // 8 + 1` is to increase the "effort" for characters based on their rank in the sorted frequency list.
        - The `sum()` function aggregates these values to get the total minimum pushes.

6. **Return the Result**:
    ```python
    return min_pushes
    ```
    - Return the calculated minimum number of pushes.

### Example

Let's take an example to illustrate the function:

```python
solution = Solution()
result = solution.minimumPushes("aabbccddeeffgg")
print(result)
```

- For the input "aabbccddeeffgg", each character appears twice.
- Frequencies: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`
- Sorted Frequencies: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`
- Push calculation:
  - For `i=0` to `i=7`: Pushes = `2 * (0 // 8 + 1) = 2 * 1 = 2`
- Sum of pushes: `2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14`

Thus, the function will return `14` for the given input.
