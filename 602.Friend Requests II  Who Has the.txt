602.Friend Requests II : Who Has the Most Friends
Explaination:

This MySQL query aims to find the ID (either requester ID or accepter ID) with the highest number of occurrences in the `RequestAccepted` table. It achieves this by first calculating the count of occurrences for each ID (requester or accepter) separately, then combining the results using `UNION`, and finally selecting the record with the highest count.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **First Part (Requester IDs)**:
   - It selects the `requester_id` column and renames it as `id`.
   - It includes a subquery that counts the occurrences of the `requester_id` or `accepter_id` in the `RequestAccepted` table based on the current row's `id`.
   - The main query groups the results by `requester_id`.

```sql
SELECT requester_id AS id,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM RequestAccepted  
     WHERE (requester_id = id OR accepter_id = id)) AS num
FROM RequestAccepted
GROUP BY requester_id
```

2. **Second Part (Accepter IDs)**:
   - It selects the `accepter_id` column and renames it as `id`.
   - It includes a similar subquery as in the first part, counting the occurrences of the `requester_id` or `accepter_id` in the `RequestAccepted` table based on the current row's `id`.
   - The main query groups the results by `accepter_id`.

```sql
UNION 
SELECT accepter_id AS id,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM RequestAccepted  
     WHERE (requester_id = id OR accepter_id = id)) AS num
FROM RequestAccepted
GROUP BY accepter_id
```

3. **Combining and Ordering**:
   - It combines the results of the two parts using `UNION`.
   - It orders the combined results by the count (`num`) in descending order.
   - It limits the result to the first row, thus selecting the ID with the highest count.

```sql
ORDER BY num DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

This query should accurately find the ID (requester or accepter) with the highest number of occurrences in the `RequestAccepted` table.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below

select requester_id as id,
    (select count(*) from RequestAccepted  where (requester_id = id or accepter_id = id)) as num
from RequestAccepted
group by requester_id
union 
select accepter_id as id,
    (select count(*) from RequestAccepted  where (requester_id = id or accepter_id = id)) as num
from RequestAccepted
group by accepter_id
order by num desc limit 1;
