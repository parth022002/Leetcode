330.Patching Array	
Explanation:

The `minPatches` method is designed to determine the minimum number of patches (i.e., additions of integers) needed to ensure that all integers from 1 to `n` can be formed using the elements from the given list `nums`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

### Initialization:
- `missing`: This variable represents the smallest number that we cannot currently form. Initially, it's set to 1 because we start by trying to ensure we can form the number 1.
- `patches`: This keeps track of the number of patches (additions) we have made. Initially, it's set to 0.
- `index`: This is the index in the `nums` list. It starts at 0.

### Main Loop:
The algorithm uses a while loop that continues as long as `missing` is less than or equal to `n`. Within this loop, it performs the following steps:

1. **Check if the current number in `nums` can help us form `missing`**:
   - If `index < len(nums)` and `nums[index] <= missing`, it means the current number in `nums` can be used to form the current `missing` value. 
   - In this case, we add `nums[index]` to `missing`, effectively increasing the range of numbers we can form.
   - We then move to the next number in `nums` by incrementing `index`.

2. **Patch (add a new number)**:
   - If the current number in `nums` is too large to help with the current `missing` value (i.e., `nums[index] > missing`), we need to patch.
   - To patch, we add `missing` itself to the sequence. This means we can now form the number `missing` and also extend the range of numbers we can form.
   - We increment `patches` since we added a new number.

The loop continues this way, either consuming elements from `nums` or adding new elements as patches, until we can form all numbers up to `n`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider `nums = [1, 3]` and `n = 6`:

1. Initial state: `missing = 1`, `patches = 0`, `index = 0`
2. The first number in `nums` is 1, which is `<= missing`. So, `missing` becomes 2 (1+1), and `index` becomes 1.
3. Now, `missing = 2`, `index = 1`. The next number in `nums` is 3, which is `> missing`. So, we patch by adding `missing` itself. `missing` becomes 4 (2+2), and `patches` becomes 1.
4. Now, `missing = 4`, `index = 1`. The next number in `nums` is 3, which is `<= missing`. So, `missing` becomes 7 (4+3), and `index` becomes 2.
5. Now, `missing = 7`, which is greater than `n`. The loop terminates.

The result is `patches = 1`.

This algorithm ensures that the minimal number of patches are used to cover all integers from 1 to `n`, leveraging the existing numbers in `nums` as much as possible.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
        missing = 1
        patches = 0
        index = 0

        while missing <= n:
            if index < len(nums) and nums[index] <= missing:
                missing += nums[index]
                index += 1
            else:
                missing += missing
                patches += 1

        return patches
