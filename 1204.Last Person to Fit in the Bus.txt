1204.Last Person to Fit in the Bus
Explaination:

This MySQL query retrieves the name of the person whose turn is served next based on the given conditions. It joins the `Queue` table with itself to compare the turns and weights, and then groups the results by turn, filtering by the total weight constraint.

Here's the breakdown:

```sql
SELECT q1.person_name
```
- This selects the name of the person from the `Queue`.

```sql
FROM Queue q1 JOIN Queue q2 ON q1.turn >= q2.turn
```
- This performs a self-join of the `Queue` table (aliased as `q1` and `q2`) based on the condition that `q1`'s turn is greater than or equal to `q2`'s turn.

```sql
GROUP BY q1.turn
```
- It groups the results by `q1`'s turn.

```sql
HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000
```
- It filters the grouped results, ensuring that the sum of weights served up to this turn (from `q2`) does not exceed 1000.

```sql
ORDER BY SUM(q2.weight) DESC
```
- It orders the results based on the sum of weights served, in descending order.

```sql
LIMIT 1
```
- It limits the result to one row, effectively selecting the person whose turn is served next and satisfies the weight constraint.

Overall, this query identifies the person whose turn is next to be served based on the turn order and ensures that the total weight served up to that point does not exceed 1000.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    q1.person_name
FROM Queue q1 JOIN Queue q2 ON q1.turn >= q2.turn
GROUP BY q1.turn
HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY SUM(q2.weight) DESC
LIMIT 1
