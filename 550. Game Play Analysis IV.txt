550. Game Play Analysis IV
Explaination:

This MySQL query calculates the fraction of players who logged in on the day after they first joined the game. Here's the breakdown:

1. The inner subquery retrieves the earliest login date (`first_login`) for each player using the `GROUP BY` clause.
2. It then compares each player's ID and the date one day before their first login date.
3. The main query calculates the count of distinct player IDs meeting the criteria specified in the subquery and divides it by the count of all distinct player IDs in the `Activity` table.
4. The result is rounded to two decimal places.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity
WHERE (player_id, DATE_SUB(event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) IN (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login 
    FROM Activity 
    GROUP BY player_id
);
```

This query provides the fraction of players who logged in the day after they first joined the game, considering the entire `Activity` table.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity
WHERE (player_id, DATE_SUB(event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) IN ( SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id)
