1484.Group Sold Products By The Date
Explaination:

This MySQL query selects data from the `activities` table and performs the following operations:

1. It counts the number of distinct products sold (`num_sold`) on each `sell_date`.
2. It concatenates the distinct product names (`product`) separated by a comma for each `sell_date`, ordered alphabetically (`ORDER BY product ASC`).
3. It groups the results by `sell_date`.
4. It orders the results by `sell_date`.

Here's the breakdown of the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS products
```
- It selects the `sell_date` column.
- It counts the number of distinct products (`product`) sold on each `sell_date` and aliases it as `num_sold`.
- It concatenates the distinct product names (`product`) ordered alphabetically, separated by a comma using `GROUP_CONCAT`.

```sql
FROM activities
```
- It specifies that the data is retrieved from the `activities` table.

```sql
GROUP BY sell_date
```
- It groups the results by `sell_date`, so the aggregation functions (`COUNT` and `GROUP_CONCAT`) are applied per unique `sell_date`.

```sql
ORDER BY sell_date;
```
- It orders the results by `sell_date` in ascending order.

Overall, this query provides the count of distinct products sold and a concatenated list of distinct product names for each `sell_date`.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT sell_date,
       count(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
       group_concat(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ',') products
  FROM activities
 GROUP BY sell_date
 ORDER BY sell_date;
