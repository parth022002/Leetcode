2958.Length of Longest subarray with at Most K frequency
Explaination:

This code seems to be trying to find the length of the longest subarray where the frequency of each element is at most k. Let's break down the code:

1. `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the length of the longest subarray that satisfies the condition.
2. `mp` is a dictionary that will keep track of the frequency of elements in the current subarray.
3. `l` is a pointer that represents the left boundary of the current subarray.
4. `n` stores the length of the input array `nums`.
5. The loop iterates over each element of the input array `nums` using the variable `r`.
6. For each element `nums[r]`, its frequency in the current subarray is updated in the dictionary `mp`.
7. If the frequency of `nums[r]` exceeds `k`, it means the current subarray contains more than `k` occurrences of the same element. In this case, we need to adjust the left boundary of the subarray to maintain the condition.
8. The while loop shifts the left boundary (`l`) to the right until the frequency of `nums[r]` becomes equal to `k`.
9. The length of the current subarray `(r - l + 1)` is calculated and compared with the current maximum length `ans`. If it's greater, `ans` is updated.
10. Finally, the function returns the maximum length `ans`.

The code looks correct for the given problem statement. It maintains a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of subarrays with at most `k` occurrences of each element.
