1581.Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the `customer_id` from the `Visits` table and the count of `visit_id` from the `Transactions` table using a LEFT JOIN operation on the `visit_id` column. It then filters the results to only include visits where there was no transaction made, and finally, groups the results by `customer_id`.

Here's the query:

```mysql
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
FROM Visits v 
LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id  
WHERE t.amount IS NULL 
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
```

This query fetches data from two tables, `Visits` and `Transactions`, using a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all records from the `Visits` table are returned, regardless of whether there is a corresponding record in the `Transactions` table. It then filters out the visits where no transaction was made (where `t.amount` is NULL) and groups the results by `customer_id`, providing the count of visits with no transactions for each customer.

GROUP BY v.customer_id;
