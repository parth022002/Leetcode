2890.Reshape Data: Melt
Explaination:

This Python function, `meltTable`, transforms the input DataFrame `report` from wide to long format using the `pd.melt()` function. Let's break down the code:

1. `import pandas as pd`: This line imports the pandas library, a popular library for data manipulation and analysis.

2. `def meltTable(report: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:`: This line defines a function named `meltTable`. It takes one argument, `report`, which is expected to be a pandas DataFrame. The function specifies that it will return a pandas DataFrame.

3. `return pd.melt(report, id_vars=['product'], var_name='quarter', value_name='sales')`: This line uses the `pd.melt()` function to transform the DataFrame from wide to long format.
   - `report`: This is the DataFrame to be melted.
   - `id_vars=['product']`: This parameter specifies which column(s) should be retained as identifier variables. In this case, "product" column is retained.
   - `var_name='quarter'`: This parameter specifies the name of the new column that will store the variable names (in this case, quarters).
   - `value_name='sales'`: This parameter specifies the name of the new column that will store the values (in this case, sales).
   - The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique combination of "product" and "quarter", and the "sales" column contains the corresponding values.

4. There is no code for "explain" or any comment explaining the function, but typically, such a line would be used to provide documentation or clarification for the function's purpose.

In summary, the `meltTable` function takes a DataFrame in wide format, with products as rows and quarters as columns, and transforms it into long format, where each row represents a unique combination of product and quarter, and sales are stored as values.

Solution:

import pandas as pd

def meltTable(report: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.melt(report, id_vars=['product'], var_name='quarter', value_name='sales')
