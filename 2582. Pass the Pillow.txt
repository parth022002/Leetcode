2582. Pass the Pillow
Solution:

class Solution:
    def passThePillow(self, n: int, time: int) -> int:
        completed = time // (n - 1)
        remaining = time % (n - 1)
        ans = 0
        if completed % 2 != 0:
            ans = n - remaining
        else:
            ans = remaining + 1
        return ans

Explanation:

Sure, let's break down the steps of the `passThePillow` function in the Python code:

```python
class Solution:
    def passThePillow(self, n: int, time: int) -> int:
        completed = time // (n - 1)
        remaining = time % (n - 1)
        ans = 0
        if completed % 2 != 0:
            ans = n - remaining
        else:
            ans = remaining + 1
        return ans
```

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function `passThePillow` takes two arguments:
     - `n`: The number of people in the circle.
     - `time`: The total time elapsed.

2. **Calculate Complete Rounds**:
   ```python
   completed = time // (n - 1)
   ```
   - This calculates the number of complete back-and-forth rounds the pillow has passed through the circle.
   - `(n - 1)` is used because passing the pillow from the first person to the last person and back to the first person takes `n - 1` moves.
   - `//` is integer division, which gives the number of complete rounds.

3. **Calculate Remaining Time**:
   ```python
   remaining = time % (n - 1)
   ```
   - This calculates the remaining time after the complete rounds have been accounted for.
   - `%` is the modulo operator, which gives the remainder of the division of `time` by `n - 1`.

4. **Determine the Pillow Position**:
   ```python
   ans = 0
   if completed % 2 != 0:
       ans = n - remaining
   else:
       ans = remaining + 1
   ```
   - Initialize `ans` to 0.
   - Check if the number of complete rounds (`completed`) is odd or even:
     - If `completed` is odd (`completed % 2 != 0`), the pillow is moving in the reverse direction:
       ```python
       ans = n - remaining
       ```
       - Subtract the `remaining` time from `n` to find the current position.
     - If `completed` is even, the pillow is moving in the forward direction:
       ```python
       ans = remaining + 1
       ```
       - Add 1 to the `remaining` time to find the current position.

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```python
   return ans
   ```
   - Return the calculated position of the pillow.

### Example

Let's go through an example to illustrate the steps:

- Suppose `n = 5` (5 people) and `time = 8`.

1. Calculate complete rounds:
   ```python
   completed = 8 // (5 - 1) = 8 // 4 = 2
   ```

2. Calculate remaining time:
   ```python
   remaining = 8 % (5 - 1) = 8 % 4 = 0
   ```

3. Determine the pillow position:
   ```python
   completed = 2 (even)
   ans = remaining + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
   ```

Thus, after 8 units of time, the pillow is with the 1st person.
