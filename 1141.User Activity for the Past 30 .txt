1141.User Activity for the Past 30 Days I
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the activity date (`activity_date`) as "day" and counts the distinct user IDs (`user_id`) as "active_users" for each day. It focuses on the activity between June 28, 2019, and July 27, 2019. Here's the breakdown:

1. `SELECT activity_date AS day`: This selects the `activity_date` column from the `Activity` table and renames it as "day".

2. `COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users`: This counts the distinct user IDs for each day to determine the number of active users.

3. `FROM Activity`: This specifies the `Activity` table.

4. `WHERE (activity_date > "2019-06-27" AND activity_date <= "2019-07-27")`: This filters the rows to include only those with activity dates between June 28, 2019, and July 27, 2019.

5. `GROUP BY activity_date`: This groups the results by the activity date.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT activity_date AS day, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE (activity_date > "2019-06-27" AND activity_date <= "2019-07-27")
GROUP BY activity_date;
```

This query provides a count of distinct active users for each day within the specified date range.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE (activity_date > "2019-06-27" AND activity_date <= "2019-07-27")
GROUP BY activity_date;
