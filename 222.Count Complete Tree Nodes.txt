222.Count Complete Tree Nodes
Explanation:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `countNodes`. This method takes the root of a binary tree (`root`) as input and returns the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Here's how the code works:

1. **Base Case:**
   - The code first checks if the `root` is `None`. If it is, it means the tree is empty, so it returns `0` indicating that there are no nodes in the tree.

2. **Recursive Counting:**
   - If the `root` is not `None`, it initializes a variable `count` to `1`. This `1` represents the current node.
   - It then checks if the left child of the current node (`root.left`) is not `None`. If it's not `None`, it recursively calls the `countNodes` function with the left child of the current node and adds the returned count to the `count` variable.
   - Similarly, it checks if the right child of the current node (`root.right`) is not `None`. If it's not `None`, it recursively calls the `countNodes` function with the right child of the current node and adds the returned count to the `count` variable.

3. **Return Count:**
   - Finally, it returns the total count of nodes in the binary tree.

This method effectively counts the nodes in the binary tree by recursively traversing each node and adding `1` for each encountered node. It traverses both the left and right subtrees recursively and accumulates the counts. Finally, it returns the total count of nodes.

Solution:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        count = 1

        if root.left is not None:
            count += self.countNodes(root.left)
        if root.right is not None:
            count += self.countNodes(root.right)

        return count
