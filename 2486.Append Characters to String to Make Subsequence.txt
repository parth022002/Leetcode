2486.Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence
Explanation:

The solution you provided is designed to solve the problem of determining how many characters need to be appended to the end of the string `s` to make it a subsequence of the string `t`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `m` is assigned the length of string `s`.
   - `n` is assigned the length of string `t`.

2. **Index Pointers:**
   - Two index pointers, `i` and `j`, are initialized to 0. `i` will traverse string `s` and `j` will traverse string `t`.

3. **While Loop:**
   - The loop continues until either `i` reaches the end of `s` (i.e., `i < m`) or `j` reaches the end of `t` (i.e., `j < n`).

4. **Character Matching:**
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the characters at the current indices of `s` and `t` match (`s[i] == t[j]`).
   - If they match, it means that the character from `t` is found in `s`, so the index `j` is incremented to move to the next character in `t`.
   - Regardless of whether a match is found or not, `i` is incremented to move to the next character in `s`.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - Once the loop ends, it means either all characters of `s` have been checked or all characters of `t` have been matched.
   - The result is `n - j`, which represents the number of characters in `t` that have not been matched in `s`. These are the characters that need to be appended to `s` to make it a subsequence of `t`.

Here is the solution in code format for better readability:

```python
class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        m = len(s)
        n = len(t)
        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < m and j < n:
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                j += 1
            i += 1

        return n - j
```

### Example
Let's see an example to understand how the code works.

Suppose `s = "abc"` and `t = "abdec"`:

1. `m = 3` (length of `s`)
2. `n = 5` (length of `t`)
3. Initially, `i = 0` and `j = 0`

The while loop will execute as follows:
- `i = 0`, `j = 0`: `s[0]` is 'a' and `t[0]` is 'a' (match), so `j` becomes 1, `i` becomes 1
- `i = 1`, `j = 1`: `s[1]` is 'b' and `t[1]` is 'b' (match), so `j` becomes 2, `i` becomes 2
- `i = 2`, `j = 2`: `s[2]` is 'c' and `t[2]` is 'd' (no match), so `i` becomes 3

The loop exits because `i < m` condition fails.

Result: `n - j` = `5 - 2` = 3. Therefore, 3 characters need to be appended to `s` to make it a subsequence of `t`.

This code efficiently solves the problem with a time complexity of O(m + n) by using a two-pointer technique.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        m = len(s)
        n = len(t)
        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < m and j < n:
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                j += 1
            i += 1

        return n - j
