205.Isomorphic String
Explaination:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isIsomorphic` to determine if two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic. Two strings are considered isomorphic if all occurrences of each character in string `s` can be replaced with another character to get `t`, while preserving the order. 

Here's the explanation of the code:

1. `indexS = [0] * 200` and `indexT = [0] * 200`: These lines initialize two lists, `indexS` and `indexT`, each containing 200 elements initialized to 0. These lists will be used to store the last seen index of each character in strings `s` and `t` respectively. The reason for using 200 is to accommodate the ASCII range of characters (0 to 127).

2. `length = len(s)`: This line calculates the length of the input string `s`. 

3. `if length != len(t): return False`: This checks if the lengths of both strings `s` and `t` are equal. If they're not, the function returns `False`, indicating that the strings cannot be isomorphic.

4. `for i in range(length):`: This loop iterates through each character index `i` from 0 to `length - 1` in the strings `s` and `t`.

5. `if indexS[ord(s[i])] != indexT[ord(t[i])]: return False`: This condition checks if the last seen index of the current character in `s` (`ord(s[i])`) is not equal to the last seen index of the current character in `t` (`ord(t[i])`). If they are not equal, it means that the current characters in `s` and `t` cannot be mapped to each other, so the function returns `False`.

6. `indexS[ord(s[i])] = i + 1` and `indexT[ord(t[i])] = i + 1`: These lines update the last seen index of the current character in `s` and `t` respectively to the current index `i + 1`.

7. After iterating through all characters in both strings without finding any discrepancies, the function returns `True`, indicating that the strings are isomorphic.

In summary, this code efficiently determines if two strings are isomorphic by using two lists to keep track of the last seen index of characters in both strings and comparing them.


Solution:

class Solution:

    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        indexS = [0] * 200
        indexT = [0] * 200

        length = len(s)

        if length != len(t):
            return False
        
        for i in range(length):
            if indexS[ord(s[i])] != indexT[ord(t[i])]:
                return False
            
            indexS[ord(s[i])] = i + 1
            indexT[ord(t[i])] = i + 1

        return True
