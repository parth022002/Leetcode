1174.Immediate Food Delivery II
Explaination:

This MySQL query calculates the percentage of immediate deliveries, where the order date matches the customer's preferred delivery date, for each customer. Here's the breakdown:

1. The inner subquery retrieves the earliest order date (`MIN(order_date)`) for each customer using the `GROUP BY` clause.
2. It then compares each customer's ID and their earliest order date.
3. The outer query calculates the sum of immediate deliveries (where order date equals customer preferred delivery date) and divides it by the count of distinct customer IDs, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.
4. The result is rounded to two decimal places.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    SUM(IF(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, 0)) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100, 2
) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
);
```

This query provides the percentage of immediate deliveries for each customer based on their earliest order date in the `Delivery` table.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(SUM(IF(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, 0)) / 
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
