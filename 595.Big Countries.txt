Explaination:

```mysql
EXPLAIN SELECT name, population, area FROM world WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

This MySQL query selects the `name`, `population`, and `area` columns from the `world` table where either the `area` is greater than or equal to 3,000,000 or the `population` is greater than or equal to 25,000,000. The `EXPLAIN` statement is used to obtain information about how MySQL executes the query, such as which indexes are used and the order of operations.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name, population, area from world where area >= 3000000 or population >= 25000000;
