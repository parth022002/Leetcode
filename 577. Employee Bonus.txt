577. Employee Bonus
Explaination:

Your SQL query selects the `name` and `bonus` columns from the `Employee` table and the `Bonus` table, respectively, and combines them using a left join on the `empID` column. Then, it filters the result to include only those records where the bonus is less than 1000 or where there is no corresponding bonus record (i.e., the bonus is NULL).

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT Employee.name, Bonus.bonus 
FROM Employee 
LEFT JOIN Bonus ON Employee.empID = Bonus.empID 
WHERE Bonus.bonus < 1000 OR Bonus.bonus IS NULL;
```

This query will return the names of employees along with their bonuses, where the bonus is less than 1000 or the employee doesn't have a bonus record.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Employee.name,Bonus.bonus FROM Employee
LEFT JOIN Bonus ON Employee.empID = Bonus.empID
WHERE bonus < 1000 OR Bonus IS NULL
