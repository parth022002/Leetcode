3068.Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values
Explanation:

Let's break down the `maximumValueSum` function in detail:

### Inputs:
1. `nums`: A list of integers representing the values of nodes.
2. `k`: An integer used in the XOR operation.
3. `edges`: A list of lists representing edges between nodes (not used in the current function).

### Goal:
To maximize the sum of node values after performing the XOR operation with `k` on some of the node values.

### Steps in the function:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `totalSum` to hold the sum of the current node values.
   - `count` to count how many node values were increased by the XOR operation.
   - `positiveMin` to keep track of the smallest net positive change caused by the XOR operation.
   - `negativeMax` to keep track of the largest net negative change caused by the XOR operation.

2. **Iterate Through Node Values:**
   - For each node value in `nums`, compute the value after XOR with `k`:
     ```python
     nodeValAfterOperation = nodeValue ^ k
     ```
   - Calculate the net change caused by this operation:
     ```python
     netChange = nodeValAfterOperation - nodeValue
     ```
   - Add the original node value to `totalSum`.

3. **Evaluate the Net Change:**
   - If the net change is positive:
     - Update `positiveMin` to be the minimum of the current `positiveMin` and the `netChange`.
     - Add the net change to `totalSum` because it increases the total sum.
     - Increment the `count` by 1.
   - If the net change is negative:
     - Update `negativeMax` to be the maximum of the current `negativeMax` and the `netChange`.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - If the count of positive net changes (`count`) is even, return `totalSum` as is.
   - If `count` is odd, return the maximum of:
     - `totalSum - positiveMin`: This effectively "undoes" the smallest positive change to make the count even.
     - `totalSum + negativeMax`: This effectively "adds back" the largest negative change to make the count even.

### Explanation with Examples:

1. **Example with Even Positive Changes:**
   ```python
   nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 2
   ```
   - After XOR:
     - 1 ^ 2 = 3 (net change = 2)
     - 2 ^ 2 = 0 (net change = -2)
     - 3 ^ 2 = 1 (net change = -2)
   - Positive changes count is 1, which is odd.
   - To make it even, consider `totalSum - positiveMin` or `totalSum + negativeMax`.

2. **Example with Odd Positive Changes:**
   ```python
   nums = [5, 7, 9], k = 3
   ```
   - After XOR:
     - 5 ^ 3 = 6 (net change = 1)
     - 7 ^ 3 = 4 (net change = -3)
     - 9 ^ 3 = 10 (net change = 1)
   - Positive changes count is 2, which is even.
   - Return `totalSum` as is.

### Edge Cases:
- If no net positive changes are found, `positiveMin` remains `float("inf")`, ensuring the condition for subtracting `positiveMin` is not used incorrectly.
- Similarly, if no net negative changes are found, `negativeMax` remains `float("-inf")`.

### Conclusion:
This approach ensures the maximum possible sum of node values after performing XOR operations and balancing the sum adjustments to keep the number of positive changes even.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def maximumValueSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        totalSum = 0
        count = 0
        positiveMin = float("inf")
        negativeMax = float("-inf")

        for nodeValue in nums:
            nodeValAfterOperation = nodeValue ^ k

            totalSum += nodeValue
            netChange = nodeValAfterOperation - nodeValue

            if netChange > 0:
                positiveMin = min(positiveMin, netChange)
                totalSum += netChange
                count += 1
            else:
                negativeMax = max(negativeMax, netChange)

        if count % 2 == 0:
            return totalSum
        return max(totalSum - positiveMin, totalSum + negativeMax)
