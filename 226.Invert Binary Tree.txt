226.Invert Binary Tree
Explaination:

The provided code defines a Python class `Solution` with a method `invertTree`, which takes a binary tree node `root` and returns its inverted binary tree. The inversion involves swapping the left and right children of each node in the tree.

Here's how the code works:

1. It checks if the current node `root` is `None`. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating the end of the tree.
2. If `root` is not `None`, it swaps its left and right children.
3. It then recursively calls `invertTree` on the left and right children of the current node.
4. Finally, it returns the modified `root`.

This code successfully inverts the given binary tree recursively. However, note that there is a small issue: if `root` is `None`, it should return `None` directly without attempting to access its left and right children. This will prevent unnecessary recursion and also handle the case where an empty tree is passed.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        tmp = root.left
        root.left = self.invertTree(root.right)
        root.right = self.invertTree(tmp)
        
        return root
```

This version ensures that if `root` is `None`, it returns `None` directly without any further processing.

Solution:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root:TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        tmp = root.left
        root.left = root.right
        root.right = tmp
        
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)

        return root
