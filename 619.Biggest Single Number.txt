619.Biggest Single Number
Explaination:

This MySQL query retrieves the maximum unique number from the `MyNumbers` table. Here's the breakdown:

1. The inner query selects all numbers (`num`) from the `MyNumbers` table, grouping them by number (`GROUP BY num`).
   
2. It filters out only those numbers that appear exactly once by using the `HAVING COUNT(num) = 1` clause.
   
3. The outer query selects the maximum value from the unique numbers obtained from the inner query.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
) AS unique_numbers;
```

This query provides the maximum unique number from the `MyNumbers` table, which appears only once in the dataset.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
) AS unique_numbers;
