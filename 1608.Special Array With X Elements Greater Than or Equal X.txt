1608.Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X
Explanation:

The provided solution is designed to solve the problem of finding a special number \( x \) in an array `nums`. A special number \( x \) is defined as a number such that exactly \( x \) numbers in the array are greater than or equal to \( x \). If such a number \( x \) exists, the function returns \( x \); otherwise, it returns \(-1\).

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the Array**:
    ```python
    nums.sort()
    ```
    The array `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in efficiently counting how many numbers are greater than or equal to a given \( x \) using the properties of sorted arrays.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
    ```python
    n = len(nums)
    ```
    The variable `n` stores the length of the sorted array `nums`.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Values of \( x \)**:
    ```python
    for x in range(n + 1):
    ```
    The loop iterates over all possible values of \( x \) from 0 to \( n \) (inclusive). \( x \) represents the candidate special number we are testing.

4. **Count Numbers Greater Than or Equal to \( x \)**:
    ```python
    count = sum(1 for num in nums if num >= x)
    ```
    For each \( x \), the code counts how many numbers in `nums` are greater than or equal to \( x \). This is done using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function:
    - `num >= x` checks if the current number `num` is greater than or equal to \( x \).
    - `1 for num in nums if num >= x` generates a `1` for each number that satisfies the condition, effectively counting such numbers.

5. **Check If the Count Matches \( x \)**:
    ```python
    if count == x:
        return x
    ```
    After counting, the code checks if the count equals \( x \). If this condition is met, \( x \) is the special number, and the function returns \( x \).

6. **Return -1 if No Special Number Found**:
    ```python
    return -1
    ```
    If the loop completes without finding a special number \( x \) (i.e., the condition `count == x` is never met), the function returns \(-1\), indicating that no such special number exists in the array.

### Example Execution

Consider the example array `nums = [3, 5, 0, 6, 7]`:

1. **Sorting**: The array becomes `nums = [0, 3, 5, 6, 7]`.
2. **Checking Possible \( x \) Values**:
    - For \( x = 0 \):
        - Count of numbers \(\geq 0\): 5
        - 5 != 0
    - For \( x = 1 \):
        - Count of numbers \(\geq 1\): 4
        - 4 != 1
    - For \( x = 2 \):
        - Count of numbers \(\geq 2\): 4
        - 4 != 2
    - For \( x = 3 \):
        - Count of numbers \(\geq 3\): 4
        - 4 != 3
    - For \( x = 4 \):
        - Count of numbers \(\geq 4\): 3
        - 3 != 4
    - For \( x = 5 \):
        - Count of numbers \(\geq 5\): 3
        - 3 == 3 -> Special number found

In this case, the function would return \( x = 3 \) since exactly 3 numbers in the array are greater than or equal to 3.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def specialArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        
        for x in range(n + 1):
            # Count how many numbers are greater than or equal to x
            count = sum(1 for num in nums if num >= x)
            
            if count == x:
                return x
        
        return -1
