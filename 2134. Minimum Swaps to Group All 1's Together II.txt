Solution:

class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        n1 = sum(nums)  # Total number of 1's in the array
        n0 = n - n1     # Total number of 0's in the array

        # Calculate the number of 1's in the initial window of size n1
        current_ones = sum(nums[:n1])
        min_swaps = n1 - current_ones  # Initial number of swaps needed

        # Use sliding window to calculate number of 1's in all windows of size n1
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Update current_ones for the new window starting at index i
            current_ones = current_ones - nums[i - 1] + nums[(i + n1 - 1) % n]
            # Calculate the number of swaps needed for the current window
            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, n1 - current_ones)

        return min_swaps

Explanation:

Sure! Let's break down the `minSwaps` function to understand how it works step by step:

### Problem Statement
The goal is to determine the minimum number of swaps needed to group all the `1`s together in a circular array. The circular nature means that after the last element, the array wraps around to the first element.

### Function Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**:
    ```python
    n = len(nums)
    n1 = sum(nums)  # Total number of 1's in the array
    n0 = n - n1     # Total number of 0's in the array
    ```
    - `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
    - `n1` is the total number of `1`s in the array.
    - `n0` is the total number of `0`s in the array (though it is not used further in the function).

2. **Initial Window Calculation**:
    ```python
    current_ones = sum(nums[:n1])
    min_swaps = n1 - current_ones  # Initial number of swaps needed
    ```
    - `current_ones` is the number of `1`s in the initial window of size `n1` (the size of the window is the same as the number of `1`s in the array).
    - `min_swaps` is initialized as the number of `0`s in the initial window, which is calculated as `n1 - current_ones`. This represents the initial number of swaps needed to group the `1`s together within this window.

3. **Sliding Window**:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, n):
        current_ones = current_ones - nums[i - 1] + nums[(i + n1 - 1) % n]
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, n1 - current_ones)
    ```
    - This loop iterates from index `1` to `n-1`, effectively sliding the window one element to the right in each iteration.
    - `current_ones` is updated by subtracting the element that is sliding out of the window (`nums[i - 1]`) and adding the element that is entering the window (`nums[(i + n1 - 1) % n]`). The modulo operation `% n` ensures the circular nature of the array.
    - `min_swaps` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the number of swaps needed for the current window (`n1 - current_ones`).

4. **Return the Result**:
    ```python
    return min_swaps
    ```
    - Finally, the function returns the minimum number of swaps needed to group all the `1`s together in the array.

### Summary
- The function initializes by calculating the number of `1`s in the initial window.
- It then uses a sliding window technique to efficiently calculate the number of `1`s in each possible window of the same size by updating the count rather than recalculating it from scratch.
- It keeps track of the minimum number of swaps needed across all possible windows.
- The overall time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), making it efficient for large input arrays.
