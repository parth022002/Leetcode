1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
Explanation:

Sure, let's break down the improved solution step by step to understand how it works and why it is efficient.

### Problem Statement
You need to find the length of the longest subarray where the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum elements is less than or equal to a given limit.

### Key Concepts
- **Sliding Window Technique**: Helps in maintaining a subarray and adjusting its bounds efficiently.
- **Deques (Double-ended Queues)**: Used for keeping track of the minimum and maximum values within the current window.

### Explanation

#### Initialization
```python
increase = deque()  # Deque to store indices of elements in non-decreasing order
decrease = deque()  # Deque to store indices of elements in non-increasing order
left = 0            # Left boundary of the sliding window
max_length = 0      # Maximum length of the valid subarray found
```

#### Iterating through the array
```python
for right in range(len(nums)):
```
- `right` represents the right boundary of the sliding window. We iterate through each element in the array to expand the window.

#### Maintaining the Increasing Deque
```python
while increase and nums[right] < nums[increase[-1]]:
    increase.pop()
increase.append(right)
```
- We ensure the `increase` deque maintains elements in non-decreasing order.
- If the current element (`nums[right]`) is smaller than the last element in the deque (`nums[increase[-1]]`), we remove the last element (pop from the end).
- Finally, we append the current index `right` to the `increase` deque.

#### Maintaining the Decreasing Deque
```python
while decrease and nums[right] > nums[decrease[-1]]:
    decrease.pop()
decrease.append(right)
```
- We ensure the `decrease` deque maintains elements in non-increasing order.
- If the current element (`nums[right]`) is larger than the last element in the deque (`nums[decrease[-1]]`), we remove the last element (pop from the end).
- Finally, we append the current index `right` to the `decrease` deque.

#### Ensuring the Window is Valid
```python
while nums[decrease[0]] - nums[increase[0]] > limit:
    left += 1
    if increase[0] < left:
        increase.popleft()
    if decrease[0] < left:
        decrease.popleft()
```
- We check if the difference between the maximum (`nums[decrease[0]]`) and minimum (`nums[increase[0]]`) elements in the current window exceeds the `limit`.
- If it does, we increment the `left` boundary to shrink the window from the left side.
- We also ensure to remove indices from the deques that are no longer within the window's bounds (i.e., indices less than `left`).

#### Updating Maximum Length
```python
max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
```
- After ensuring the window is valid, we update the `max_length` with the current window size if it is larger than the previous maximum.

### Return the Result
```python
return max_length
```
- Finally, we return the `max_length` which is the length of the longest subarray that meets the condition.

### Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), since each element is processed at most twice (once when added and once when removed from a deque).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case, due to the space used by the deques.

This solution is efficient both in terms of runtime and memory usage, making it suitable for handling large input arrays.

Solution:

from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        increase = deque()  # Min deque
        decrease = deque()  # Max deque
        left = 0
        max_length = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            # Maintain the increasing deque
            while increase and nums[right] < nums[increase[-1]]:
                increase.pop()
            increase.append(right)
            
            # Maintain the decreasing deque
            while decrease and nums[right] > nums[decrease[-1]]:
                decrease.pop()
            decrease.append(right)
            
            # Ensure the current window is valid
            while nums[decrease[0]] - nums[increase[0]] > limit:
                left += 1
                if increase[0] < left:
                    increase.popleft()
                if decrease[0] < left:
                    decrease.popleft()
                
            # Calculate the maximum length of the subarray
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_length
