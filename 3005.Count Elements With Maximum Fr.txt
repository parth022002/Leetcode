3005.Count Elements With Maximum Frequency
Explanation:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `maxFrequencyElements` that finds the maximum frequency of any integer in the input list `nums`, and then counts how many integers have this maximum frequency.

Here's how the code works:

1. It uses the `collections.Counter` function to count the occurrences of each integer in the `nums` list and creates a dictionary-like object `f` where keys are the unique integers and values are their respective frequencies.

2. It finds the maximum frequency `mx` among all frequencies using the `max()` function.

3. It initializes a variable `c` to 0. This variable will count how many integers have the maximum frequency.

4. It iterates through each integer `x` in the `nums` list:
   - If the frequency of the current integer `x` (retrieved from the `f` dictionary) is equal to the maximum frequency `mx`, it means `x` has the maximum frequency. In this case, it increments the counter `c` by 1.

5. After iterating through all integers in the `nums` list, the function returns the value of the counter `c`, which represents the number of integers having the maximum frequency.

This code efficiently finds the maximum frequency of any integer in the input list and then counts how many integers have this maximum frequency. It utilizes the `Counter` function from the `collections` module to perform frequency counting, and then iterates through the list to count the occurrences of integers with the maximum frequency. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`, as it iterates through the list once to calculate frequencies and then again to count the occurrences of integers with the maximum frequency.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxFrequencyElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        f = collections.Counter(nums)
        mx = max(f.values())

        c = 0 
        for x in nums:
            if f[x] == mx:
                c += 1
        return c
