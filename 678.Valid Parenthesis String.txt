678.Valid Parenthesis String
Explanation:

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `checkValidString` that checks whether a given string `s` consisting of `'('`, `')'`, and `'*'` characters represents a valid string of parentheses.

Here's how the algorithm works:

- It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
- For each character:
  - If `c` is `'('`, it increments both `leftMin` and `leftMax`, representing the count of open parentheses.
  - If `c` is `')'`, it decrements both `leftMin` and `leftMax`, representing the count of open parentheses being closed.
  - If `c` is `' * '`, it could be treated as an open parenthesis `'('`, a closing parenthesis `')'`, or an empty string `''`. Therefore, it increments `leftMax` and decrements `leftMin`.
- If at any point `leftMax` becomes negative, it means there are more closing parentheses than open parentheses encountered, which violates the order. In this case, the function returns `False`.
- If `leftMin` becomes negative at any point, it's set back to 0, as negative `leftMin` implies more closing parentheses than open parentheses in the processed substring so far.
- Finally, after processing all characters, if `leftMin` is 0, it signifies that all open parentheses have been properly matched and closed. The function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This algorithm efficiently checks for valid parentheses in the string by maintaining counts of unmatched open parentheses (`leftMin` and `leftMax`). If the counts become negative at any point, it indicates an invalid parentheses order. Otherwise, if `leftMin` is 0 after processing the entire string, it signifies that all parentheses have been properly matched and closed. Thus, the string is considered valid.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        leftMin, leftMax = 0, 0

        for c in s:
            if c == "(":
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin + 1, leftMax + 1
            elif c == ")":
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin - 1, leftMax - 1
            else:
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin - 1, leftMax + 1
            if leftMax < 0:
                return False
            if leftMin < 0:
                leftMin = 0
        return leftMin == 0
