791. Custom Sort String
Explaination:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `customSortString` that sorts the characters in a string `s` according to the order specified in another string `order`. Any characters not present in the `order` string are appended to the end of the sorted string.

Here's how the method works:

1. It takes two parameters:
   - `order`: A string representing the desired order of characters.
   - `s`: A string representing the input string to be sorted.

2. It uses the `collections.Counter` function to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, storing the counts in the dictionary `s_counts`.

3. It initializes an empty list called `string_builder`, which will be used to build the sorted string.

4. It iterates through each character in the `order` string using a for loop.

5. For each character in the `order` string, it checks if it exists in the `s_counts` dictionary (i.e., if it is present in the input string `s`). If it exists:
   - It extends `string_builder` with the current character repeated by the count of occurrences of that character in the input string `s`.
   - It removes the character from the `s_counts` dictionary since it has been used.

6. After processing all characters in the `order` string, it iterates through the remaining characters in the `s_counts` dictionary using a for loop.
   - For each remaining character and its count, it extends `string_builder` with the character repeated by its count.

7. Finally, it returns the sorted string by joining the characters in `string_builder` into a single string.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the length of the `s` string and m is the length of the `order` string. This is because the code iterates through both strings once, and dictionary operations like checking for existence and deletion are typically O(1) operations.

Solution : 

class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        s_counts = collections.Counter(s)

        string_builder = []

        for char in order:
            if char in s_counts:
                string_builder.extend([char] * s_counts[char])

                del s_counts[char]
        for char, count in s_counts.items():
            string_builder.extend([char] * count)

        return "".join(string_builder)
