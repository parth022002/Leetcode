1068. Product Sales Analysis I
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` columns from the `Sales` table and the `Product` table using an INNER JOIN operation on the `product_id` column.

Here's the query:

```mysql
SELECT product_name, year, price 
FROM Sales 
INNER JOIN Product ON Sales.product_id = Product.product_id;
```

This query fetches data from two tables, `Sales` and `Product`, using an INNER JOIN to retrieve only the records that have matching `product_id` values in both tables.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please feel free to ask!

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT product_name, year, price FROM Sales
INNER JOIN Product ON
Sales.product_id = Product.product_id;
