1667.Fix Names in a Table
Explaination:

Your MySQL query is correctly formatting the names stored in the `name` column of the `Users` table. It capitalizes the first letter of each name, making sure that the rest of the name is in lowercase. Here's the breakdown:

```sql
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
```
- This part of the query selects the `user_id` column as it is and transforms the `name` column as follows:
  - `UPPER(LEFT(name, 1))` capitalizes the first letter of the name using the `LEFT` function to extract the first character and `UPPER` function to convert it to uppercase.
  - `LCASE(SUBSTRING(name, 2))` converts the rest of the name to lowercase using the `SUBSTRING` function to extract the substring starting from the second character and `LCASE` function to convert it to lowercase.
  - `CONCAT` concatenates the modified first letter with the modified rest of the name.

```sql
FROM Users
```
- This specifies that the data is being retrieved from the `Users` table.

```sql
ORDER BY user_id;
```
- This orders the result set by the `user_id` column in ascending order.

Overall, this query will return the `user_id` along with the names where the first letter is capitalized and the rest of the name is in lowercase, ordered by `user_id`.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;
