590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal
Solution:

from collections import deque
from typing import List

# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children

class Solution:
    def postorder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        
        stack = deque([root])
        output = []
        
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            output.append(node.val)
            # Add children to stack if they exist
            if node.children:
                stack.extend(node.children)
        
        # Reverse the output in place for postorder
        output.reverse()
        return output

Explanation:

This Python code is an implementation of the postorder traversal for an N-ary tree. The postorder traversal is a depth-first traversal where the nodes are visited in the following order: first the children, and then the root node.

### Components of the Code

1. **Node Class**:
    - The `Node` class defines the structure of a node in an N-ary tree.
    - Each node has a value (`val`) and a list of children (`children`).

2. **Solution Class**:
    - The `Solution` class contains the `postorder` method, which performs the postorder traversal on the N-ary tree.

### Postorder Traversal (`postorder` method)

1. **Base Case**:
   - If the root is `None` (i.e., the tree is empty), the function returns an empty list.

2. **Stack Initialization**:
   - A `deque` (double-ended queue) is used as a stack to keep track of nodes during the traversal. The root node is initially added to the stack.

3. **Traversal Loop**:
   - The loop continues until the stack is empty.
   - In each iteration, the node at the top of the stack is popped and its value is appended to the `output` list.
   - If the node has children, they are added to the stack. The children are added in the order they appear so that when they are popped off the stack, they are processed in reverse order (right-to-left). This ensures that in the final `output` list, the children are processed before their parent, which is necessary for postorder traversal.

4. **Reversing the Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the `output` list contains the nodes' values in root-first order (like a preorder traversal but with children in reverse order).
   - To get the correct postorder traversal, the list is reversed in place using `output.reverse()`.

5. **Return**:
   - Finally, the `output` list, which now contains the values in postorder, is returned.

### Example Execution

Suppose you have the following N-ary tree:

```
        1
       /|\
      3 2 4
     / \
    5   6
```

- Postorder traversal for this tree should be: `[5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1]`.

When the `postorder` function is applied to the root of this tree:
- The stack initially contains `[1]`.
- Nodes are processed in the following order: `1`, `3`, `6`, `5`, `2`, `4`.
- After reversal, the output becomes `[5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1]`.

This is the desired postorder traversal.
