2816.Double a Number Represented as a Linked List
Explanation:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `doubleIt` that takes a linked list (`head`) as input and returns a new linked list where each digit in the original list is doubled.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `values = []`: This initializes an empty list to store the values of the linked list.
   - `val = 0`: This variable will be used to compute the new value for each node by doubling its value.

2. **Traversing the Linked List**:
   - The code iterates through the original linked list (`head`) using a while loop. At each iteration, it appends the value of the current node (`head.val`) to the `values` list and moves to the next node (`head = head.next`).

3. **Processing the Values**:
   - `new_tail = None`: Initializes a variable `new_tail` to `None`, which will be used to construct the new linked list.
   - Another while loop iterates until there are values left in `values` or there's a non-zero carry value (`val != 0`).
   - Inside this loop:
     - A new `ListNode` object is created with value `0` and the previous `new_tail` as its next node. This effectively constructs the new linked list in reverse order.
     - The value for the new node (`new_tail.val`) is computed by doubling the last digit from `values` (if available), adding the carry value `val`, and then taking the remainder when divided by 10. This calculates the new digit and updates the carry.
     - After updating the value for the current node, the carry value is updated by integer division (`val //= 10`), ensuring it's either `0` or `1`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns the `new_tail`, which points to the head of the newly constructed linked list (in reverse order).

This code efficiently doubles each digit in the original linked list and constructs the resulting linked list in reverse order.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def doubleIt(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Initialize an empty list to store the values of the linked list
        values = []
        val = 0

        # Traverse the linked list and push its values onto the list
        while head is not None:
            values.append(head.val)
            head = head.next

        new_tail = None

        # Iterate over the list of values and the carryover
        while values or val != 0:
            # Create a new ListNode with value 0 and the previous tail as its next node
            new_tail = ListNode(0, new_tail)

            # Calculate the new value for the current node
            # by doubling the last digit, adding carry, and getting the remainder
            if values:
                val += values.pop() * 2
            new_tail.val = val % 10
            val //= 10

        # Return the tail of the new linked list
        return new_tail
