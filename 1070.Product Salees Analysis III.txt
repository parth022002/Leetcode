1070.Product Salees Analysis III
Explaination:

Your MySQL query retrieves the product ID, the first year of sale (`first_year`), the quantity, and the price for each product. It specifically selects the sales data for each product in the earliest year of sale. Here's the breakdown:

1. `SELECT product_id, year AS first_year, quantity, price`: This selects the columns `product_id`, `year` (aliased as `first_year`), `quantity`, and `price`.

2. `FROM sales`: This specifies the `sales` table.

3. `WHERE (product_id, year) IN (SELECT product_id, MIN(year) AS year FROM sales GROUP BY product_id)`: This filters the sales data to include only records where the combination of `product_id` and `year` matches the minimum year of sale for each product, determined by the subquery.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT product_id, 
       year AS first_year, 
       quantity, 
       price 
FROM sales 
WHERE (product_id, year) IN (
    SELECT product_id, 
           MIN(year) AS year 
    FROM sales 
    GROUP BY product_id
);
```

This query retrieves the sales data for each product in the earliest year of sale, including the product ID, the first year of sale, the quantity sold, and the price.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select product_id , year as first_year , quantity , price from sales 
where (product_id , year) in (select product_id , min(year) as year from sales group by product_id)
