1729.Find Followers Count
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the user IDs and counts the number of followers for each user from the `followers` table. It then orders the results by user ID in ascending order, and within each user ID, it orders by the number of followers in ascending order as well. Here's the breakdown:

1. `SELECT user_id, COUNT(user_id) AS followers_count`: This selects the `user_id` column and counts the occurrences of each `user_id`, representing the number of followers for each user.

2. `FROM followers`: This specifies the `followers` table.

3. `GROUP BY user_id`: This groups the results by the `user_id`, so the count of followers is aggregated for each user.

4. `ORDER BY user_id ASC, followers_count ASC`: This orders the results first by user ID in ascending order (`ASC`), and within each user ID, it orders by the number of followers in ascending order as well.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(user_id) AS followers_count
FROM followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id ASC, followers_count ASC;
```

This query retrieves the user IDs and the counts of their followers from the `followers` table, ordered first by user ID and then by the number of followers for each user in ascending order.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below

select user_id , count(user_id) as followers_count
from followers
group by user_id
order by user_id asc , followers_count asc;
