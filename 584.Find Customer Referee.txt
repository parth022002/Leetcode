584.Find Customer Referee
Explaination:

```mysql
EXPLAIN SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
```

This MySQL query selects the `name` from the `customer` table where the `referee_id` is either NULL or not equal to 2. The `EXPLAIN` statement is used to obtain information about how MySQL executes the query, such as which indexes are used and the order of operations.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name from customer where referee_id is null or referee_id !=2;
