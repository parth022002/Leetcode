1669.Merge In Between Linked Lists
Explaination:

The provided Python code defines a `Solution` class with a method `mergeInBetween` to merge two linked lists (`list1` and `list2`) by connecting a segment of `list1` from index `a` to index `b` (inclusive) with `list2`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. Initialize pointers `ptr` and `qtr` to traverse `list1`.
2. Move `ptr` to the node before the segment to be replaced.
3. Move `qtr` to the node after the segment to be replaced.
4. Connect the last node of `list2` to `qtr`, effectively merging `list2` into `list1`.
5. Return the modified `list1`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

- `ptr` is initially set to the head of `list1`.
- Iterate `ptr` forward `a - 1` times to reach the node right before the segment to be replaced.
- Move `qtr` to the node after the segment to be replaced. This is done by iterating `qtr` forward `b - a + 1` times.
- Connect the last node of `list2` to `qtr`.
- Return the modified `list1`.

Overall, this code effectively merges `list2` into `list1` by replacing the segment between indices `a` and `b` with `list2`.

Solution:

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeInBetween(self, list1: ListNode, a: int, b: int, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        ptr = list1
        for _ in range(a - 1):
            ptr = ptr.next

        qtr =ptr.next
        for _ in range(b - a + 1):
            qtr = qtr.next

        ptr.next = list2
        while list2.next:
            list2 = list2.next
        list2.next = qtr

        return list1
