596.Classes More Than 5 Students
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the classes with at least 5 students enrolled from the `Courses` table. Here's the breakdown:

1. `SELECT class`: This selects the `class` column from the `Courses` table.

2. `FROM Courses`: This specifies the `Courses` table.

3. `GROUP BY class`: This groups the results by the `class`.

4. `HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5`: This filters the groups to include only those where the count of students (`COUNT(student)`) is greater than or equal to 5.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
```

This query retrieves the classes with at least 5 students enrolled from the `Courses` table.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
