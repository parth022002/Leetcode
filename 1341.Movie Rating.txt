1341.Movie Rating
Explaination:

This MySQL query consists of two parts, each retrieving a single result:

1. The first part retrieves the name of the movie with the highest number of ratings by users.
2. The second part retrieves the title of the movie with the highest average rating in February 2020.

Here's the breakdown:

```sql
(SELECT name AS results
FROM MovieRating JOIN Users USING(user_id)
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, name
LIMIT 1)
```
- This part retrieves the name of the movie (`name`) from the `MovieRating` table, joining it with the `Users` table using the `user_id` field.
- It groups the results by the movie name (`name`).
- It orders the groups by the count of ratings (`COUNT(*)`) in descending order and by movie name (`name`) in ascending order.
- It limits the result to the first row, thus selecting the movie with the highest number of ratings.

```sql
UNION ALL
```
- This keyword combines the results of the first SELECT statement with the subsequent one.

```sql
(SELECT title AS results
FROM MovieRating JOIN Movies USING(movie_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM created_at) = 202002
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC, title
LIMIT 1)
```
- This part retrieves the title of the movie (`title`) from the `MovieRating` table, joining it with the `Movies` table using the `movie_id` field.
- It filters the results to include only ratings created in February 2020 using the `EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM created_at)` function.
- It groups the results by the movie title (`title`).
- It orders the groups by the average rating (`AVG(rating)`) in descending order and by movie title (`title`) in ascending order.
- It limits the result to the first row, thus selecting the movie with the highest average rating in February 2020.

Overall, this query retrieves the name of the movie with the highest number of ratings and the title of the movie with the highest average rating in February 2020.
