1404.Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One
Explanation:

Sure, let's break down the given Python solution for the problem of determining the number of steps to reduce a binary number, given as a string, to 1. Each step consists of either dividing the number by 2 (if it is even) or subtracting 1 (if it is odd).

The solution makes use of the properties of binary numbers and efficiently counts the steps by iterating through the string from right to left.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `steps` is initialized to 0. This variable will count the total number of steps required.
   - `carry` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of any carry-over that occurs when adding 1 to make the number even.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over the string `s` from the least significant bit (rightmost bit) to the second most significant bit (leftmost bit, excluding the first bit). This is because the most significant bit is handled separately at the end.
   - `i` represents the current position in the string, starting from `len(s) - 1` and moving towards 1.

3. **Processing Each Bit:**
   - For each bit, there are two cases to handle, depending on whether the bit is '0' or '1':
     - **Bit is '0':**
       - If there is a carry (`carry == 1`), turning a '0' into a '1' (due to the previous carry) requires adding 1 to make it '10', then dividing by 2. This takes 2 steps (one addition and one division).
       - If there is no carry (`carry == 0`), simply dividing by 2 takes 1 step.
     - **Bit is '1':**
       - If there is a carry (`carry == 1`), the bit stays '0' with a carry from the previous addition, so only a division is needed, taking 1 step.
       - If there is no carry (`carry == 0`), turning '1' into '0' with a new carry requires adding 1 to make it '10', then dividing by 2. This takes 2 steps (one addition and one division). The carry is set to 1 for the next higher bit.

4. **Final Step:**
   - After processing all bits except the most significant bit, the total steps are incremented by the carry. If there's a carry, it means an additional step is required to handle the most significant bit.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - The total number of steps, including the carry, is returned as the final answer.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to understand how the steps are calculated:

Consider `s = "1101"`:

- Start from the rightmost bit (least significant):
  - `s[3] = '1'`: No carry, so add 1 (to make it '10') and then divide by 2: steps = 2, carry = 1.
  - `s[2] = '0'`: Carry is 1, so add 1 (to make it '10') and then divide by 2: steps = 4, carry = 1.
  - `s[1] = '1'`: Carry is 1, so just divide by 2: steps = 5, carry = 1.
  - Most significant bit `s[0]` is already handled by adding the carry: steps = 6.

So, the function returns 6 steps.

This approach efficiently calculates the number of steps by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and systematically handling carries.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def numSteps(self, s: str) -> int:
        steps = 0
        carry = 0
        
        # We start processing from the least significant bit (rightmost end of the string)
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, 0, -1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                # If bit is '0', it remains '0' unless there's a carry
                if carry:
                    steps += 2  # 0 with carry becomes 10, which means add 1 and then divide by 2
                else:
                    steps += 1  # just divide by 2
            else:
                # If bit is '1', it turns to '0' with a carry, unless there's already a carry
                if carry:
                    steps += 1  # already carrying, so just division step
                else:
                    steps += 2  # add 1 to make it even, then divide by 2
                    carry = 1  # setting carry because adding 1 will affect the next significant bit
                
        # After processing all bits except the most significant bit
        return steps + carry
