1527.Patients With a Condition
Explaination:

Your MySQL query is searching for records in the `Patients` table where the `conditions` column contains the string 'DIAB1'. It's checking for both cases where 'DIAB1' appears at the beginning of the string or somewhere within it.

Here's the breakdown:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Patients 
WHERE conditions LIKE ('DIAB1%') 
OR conditions LIKE ('% DIAB1%');
```

- `SELECT *`: This selects all columns from the `Patients` table.
- `FROM Patients`: This specifies that the data is being retrieved from the `Patients` table.
- `WHERE conditions LIKE ('DIAB1%') OR conditions LIKE ('% DIAB1%')`: This filters the rows to include only those where the `conditions` column contains the string 'DIAB1' at the beginning (`DIAB1%`) or anywhere within the string (`% DIAB1%`).

Overall, this query will return records from the `Patients` table where the `conditions` column contains the string 'DIAB1' in either the beginning or somewhere within the string.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT * 
FROM Patients 
WHERE conditions LIKE ('DIAB1%') 
OR conditions LIKE ('% DIAB1%');
