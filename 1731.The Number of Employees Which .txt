1731.The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee
Explaination:

Sure, let me break down the query for you:

1. **SELECT statement**: 
   - It selects columns `employee_id` and `name` from the `Employees` table for the reporting manager (`emp1`), 
   - It also calculates two values:
     - `COUNT(emp2.employee_id)` which counts the number of reports each manager has (using the `emp2` alias), and 
     - `ROUND(AVG(emp2.age))` which calculates the average age of the reports (again using the `emp2` alias).

2. **FROM clause**:
   - It specifies that we are selecting data from the `Employees` table and aliases it as `emp1`.

3. **INNER JOIN clause**:
   - It joins the `Employees` table with itself using the alias `emp2`. 
   - The join condition is `emp1.employee_id = emp2.reports_to`, meaning it matches the `employee_id` of the manager (`emp1`) with the `reports_to` column of the employees who report to that manager (`emp2`).

4. **GROUP BY clause**:
   - It groups the results by the `employee_id` of the manager (`emp1`). This ensures that each row in the result represents a unique manager.

5. **ORDER BY clause**:
   - It orders the result set by the `employee_id` of the manager (`emp1`), ensuring the output is sorted based on the manager's ID.

Overall, this query retrieves data about managers (`emp1`) and their reports, including the count of reports and the average age of those reports, then it groups the results by the manager's ID and orders them accordingly.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    emp1.employee_id,
    emp1.name,
    COUNT(emp2.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(emp2.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees emp1
INNER JOIN Employees emp2 ON emp1.employee_id = emp2.reports_to
GROUP BY emp1.employee_id
ORDER BY emp1.employee_id
