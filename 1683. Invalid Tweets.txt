Explaination:

```mysql
EXPLAIN SELECT tweet_id FROM Tweets WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

This MySQL query selects the `tweet_id` from the `Tweets` table where the length of the `content` column is greater than 15 characters. The `EXPLAIN` statement is used to obtain information about how MySQL executes the query, such as which indexes are used and the order of operations.
