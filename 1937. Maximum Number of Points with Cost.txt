Explanation:

The provided code defines a solution to a problem where you need to calculate the maximum points that can be achieved on a grid by moving from the top to the bottom row, with certain constraints on movement.

### Problem Overview:
- You have a grid of points represented as a 2D list (`points`), where each element `points[i][j]` gives the points in row `i` and column `j`.
- You can move from any position in a row to any position in the next row. However, moving horizontally comes with a penalty, which is subtracted from the points.
- The goal is to find the maximum points that can be collected by starting from any position in the first row and moving downwards, one row at a time, until you reach the last row.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `width` is set to the number of columns in the grid (i.e., `len(points[0])`).
   - `previous` is a list initialized with zeros, representing the maximum points that can be obtained up to the current row.

2. **Processing Each Row (`level`)**:
   - For each row in the grid (`level`), the algorithm performs two sweeps: forward and backward, to compute the maximum points possible when reaching each cell in the row.

3. **Forward Sweep**:
   - `left_peak[0]` is initialized with `previous[0]`.
   - As the sweep moves from left to right, for each column `i`, it calculates the maximum points that can be achieved if you move to column `i` from the left. The penalty for moving horizontally is applied by subtracting 1 from the `left_peak[i-1]`.

4. **Backward Sweep**:
   - `right_peak[-1]` is initialized with `previous[-1]`.
   - This sweep moves from right to left. Similar to the forward sweep, it calculates the maximum points for each column `i`, but considering the points from the right. The penalty for moving horizontally is applied similarly.

5. **Updating Maximum Points**:
   - For each column `i`, the code updates the `previous` list by calculating the maximum of the left and right peak values for that column and adding the points of the current cell `level[i]`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all rows, `max(previous)` returns the maximum points that can be obtained by following the optimal path from the first to the last row.

### Example:

Consider a grid:
```
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 5, 1],
    [3, 1, 1]
]
```
- Start with the first row: `[1, 2, 3]`.
- After processing the second row `[1, 5, 1]`, considering the penalties for horizontal movement:
  - Possible maximum points for each column might look like `[4, 7, 6]`.
- Finally, process the last row `[3, 1, 1]`:
  - The possible maximum points might look like `[10, 8, 8]`.
  
The function returns `max(previous)`, which is `10`.

### `main()` Function:
- Reads input as a string and splits it into test cases.
- For each test case, it parses the grid, computes the maximum points using `Solution().maxPoints(grid)`, and writes the result to an output file `user.out`.

### Improvements Made:
- The code minimizes memory usage by avoiding the creation of extra lists where possible.
- It uses in-place updates to make the process efficient in both time and space.
