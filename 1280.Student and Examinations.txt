1280.Student and Examinations
Explaination:

This MySQL query retrieves data about students, subjects, and the number of exams each student attended. Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT S.student_id, S.student_name, T.subject_name`: This selects the student ID, student name, and subject name. 

2. `COUNT(E.student_id) AS attended_exams`: This counts the number of exams attended by each student for each subject. It uses the `Examinations` table to determine the number of exams attended by joining on both the student ID and the subject name.

3. `FROM Students S CROSS JOIN Subjects T`: This performs a cross join between the `Students` table (`S` alias) and the `Subjects` table (`T` alias). This combination ensures that all possible combinations of students and subjects are included in the result set.

4. `LEFT JOIN Examinations E ON E.student_id = S.student_id AND E.subject_name = T.subject_name`: This left joins the `Examinations` table (`E` alias) on the conditions that the student ID matches and the subject name matches.

5. `GROUP BY S.student_id, S.student_name, T.subject_name`: This groups the results by student ID, student name, and subject name.

6. `ORDER BY S.student_id, T.subject_name ASC`: This orders the result set by student ID and subject name in ascending order.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    S.student_id,
    S.student_name,
    T.subject_name,
    COUNT(E.student_id) AS attended_exams
FROM
    Students S
CROSS JOIN
    Subjects T 
LEFT JOIN
    Examinations E ON E.student_id = S.student_id AND E.subject_name = T.subject_name
GROUP BY
    S.student_id,
    S.student_name,
    T.subject_name
ORDER BY
    S.student_id,
    T.subject_name ASC;
```

This query provides a summary of the number of exams attended by each student for each subject, including students who haven't attended any exams in certain subjects.
