1915.Number of Wonderful Substrings
Explanation:

This code seems to be solving a problem related to counting wonderful substrings in a given word. A "wonderful substring" here likely means a substring in which the count of each character is odd.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It initializes an array `count` with 1024 zeros, which corresponds to the range of possible XOR values when considering substrings of the input word.

2. It initializes variables `result` to store the total count of wonderful substrings, `prefix_xor` to keep track of the XOR value of the prefix, and sets `count[prefix_xor]` to 1, indicating that an empty string (prefix with XOR value 0) is counted once.

3. It iterates through each character in the input word.

4. For each character, it calculates its index relative to 'a' and updates `prefix_xor` by XORing it with the appropriate bit shifted to represent the current character.

5. It updates `result` by adding the count of substrings with the current `prefix_xor`. Additionally, it iterates through each bit (10 bits in total since we are working with 1024) and adds the count of substrings with `prefix_xor` XORed with each bit flipped. This accounts for all possible substrings that could be formed.

6. Finally, it increments the count of the current `prefix_xor` in the `count` array.

The approach seems to be using the property of XOR to efficiently count substrings with odd counts of each character. It's an interesting algorithmic technique.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def wonderfulSubstrings(self, word: str) -> int:
        count = [0] * 1024  # 2^10 to store XOR values
        result = 0
        prefix_xor = 0
        count[prefix_xor] = 1
        
        for char in word:
            char_index = ord(char) - ord('a')
            prefix_xor ^= 1 << char_index
            result += count[prefix_xor]
            for i in range(10):
                result += count[prefix_xor ^ (1 << i)]
            count[prefix_xor] += 1
        
        return result
