2962.Count Subarrays Where Max Element Appears at Least k Times
Explanation:

It seems like you're trying to implement a function that counts the number of subarrays in a given list `nums` where the number of occurrences of the maximum element in the subarray is exactly equal to `k`.

Your implementation is on the right track, but there are a few issues:

1. **List Import:** You're using `List[int]` in function definition, which requires importing `List` from `typing`. Ensure you have `from typing import List` at the beginning of your code.

2. **Initialization of `res`:** You should initialize `res` as `res = 0` outside the loop to accumulate the counts correctly.

3. **Counting Subarrays:** The logic to count subarrays with exactly `k` occurrences of the maximum element isn't correctly implemented. You're just adding `l + 1` to the result, which isn't correct. You need to count all the possible subarrays from `l` to `r` satisfying the condition. 

Here's the corrected version:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        max_n, max_count = max(nums), 0
        l = 0
        res = 0

        for r in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[r] == max_n:
                max_count += 1

            while max_count > k or (l <= r and max_count == k and nums[l] != max_n):
                if nums[l] == max_n:
                    max_count -= 1
                l += 1
            
            if max_count == k:
                res += r - l + 1
        return res
```

This corrected version should give you the desired output.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        max_n, max_count = max(nums), 0
        l = 0
        res = 0

        for r in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[r] == max_n:
                max_count += 1

            while max_count > k or (l <= r and max_count == k and nums[l] != max_n):
                if nums[l] == max_n:
                    max_count -= 1
                l += 1
            if max_count == k:
                res += l + 1
        return res
