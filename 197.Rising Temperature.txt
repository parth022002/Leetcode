197.Rising Temperature
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the `id` from the `Weather` table where there exists another record (w2) with a date exactly one day before (DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1) and the temperature on that day (w1) is higher than the temperature on the previous day (w2).

Here's the query:

```mysql
SELECT w1.id 
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

This query compares each record (w1) in the `Weather` table with another record (w2) where the date is exactly one day before, and then checks if the temperature on the later date (w1) is higher than the temperature on the previous day (w2).
