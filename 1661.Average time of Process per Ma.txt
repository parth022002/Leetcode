1661.Average time of Process per Machine
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the `machine_id` from the `Activity` table and calculates the average processing time for each machine by subtracting the `timestamp` of the 'start' activity from the `timestamp` of the corresponding 'end' activity, rounded to three decimal places.

Here's the query:

```mysql
SELECT a1.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, a1.timestamp, a2.timestamp)), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2
ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
AND a1.activity_type = 'start' AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY a1.machine_id;
```

This query performs a self-join on the `Activity` table to pair 'start' and 'end' activities based on the `machine_id` and `process_id`. Then it calculates the difference in seconds between the timestamps of paired activities and calculates the average processing time for each machine. The `ROUND()` function is used to round the average processing time to three decimal places.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a2.timestamp-a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time
from Activity a1
join Activity a2
on a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id and a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.activity_type='start' and a2.activity_type='end'
group by a1.machine_id
