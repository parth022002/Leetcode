648.Replace Words
Explanation:

Certainly! The code provided defines a method `replaceWords` in the `Solution` class, which takes two arguments: a list of strings `dict` and a string `sentence`. The goal of this method is to replace words in the `sentence` with their respective roots from the `dict` if a root exists. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Create a Set of Roots**:
    ```python
    roots = set(dict)
    ```
    This line converts the list `dict` into a set `roots`. Using a set here is efficient because checking for the existence of an element in a set is on average O(1) time complexity.

2. **Split the Sentence into Words**:
    ```python
    words = sentence.split()
    ```
    This splits the input `sentence` into individual words based on spaces, resulting in a list `words`.

3. **Initialize the Result List**:
    ```python
    result = []
    ```
    This creates an empty list `result` that will store the processed words.

4. **Iterate Over Each Word**:
    ```python
    for word in words:
    ```
    This loop iterates over each word in the `words` list.

5. **Find and Replace with Root**:
    ```python
    for i in range(len(word) + 1):
        prefix = word[:i]
        if prefix in roots:
            result.append(prefix)
            break
    else:
        result.append(word)
    ```
    For each word, another loop is used to generate prefixes from the beginning of the word up to its full length plus one (`len(word) + 1`). The prefixes are created by slicing the word: `word[:i]`.

    - If a prefix is found in the `roots` set, that prefix is added to the `result` list, and the loop breaks, moving to the next word.
    - If no prefix is found by the end of the loop (meaning no root matches any prefix of the word), the original word is added to the `result` list.

6. **Join the Result into a Sentence**:
    ```python
    return ' '.join(result)
    ```
    Finally, the `result` list, which now contains the modified words, is joined back into a single string with spaces between the words, and this string is returned as the output.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the input:
- `dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]`
- `sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"`

1. `roots` will be `{"cat", "bat", "rat"}`.
2. `words` will be `["the", "cattle", "was", "rattled", "by", "the", "battery"]`.

Processing each word:

- "the": No prefix found in `roots`. Add "the" to `result`.
- "cattle": Prefix "cat" found in `roots`. Add "cat" to `result`.
- "was": No prefix found in `roots`. Add "was" to `result`.
- "rattled": Prefix "rat" found in `roots`. Add "rat" to `result`.
- "by": No prefix found in `roots`. Add "by" to `result`.
- "the": No prefix found in `roots`. Add "the" to `result`.
- "battery": Prefix "bat" found in `roots`. Add "bat" to `result`.

The `result` list will be `["the", "cat", "was", "rat", "by", "the", "bat"]`, which is joined into the final sentence: `"the cat was rat by the bat"`.

    def replaceWords(self, dict: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:
        roots = set(dict)
        words = sentence.split()
        result = []

        for word in words:
            for i in range(len(word) + 1):
                prefix = word[:i]
                if prefix in roots:
                    result.append(prefix)
                    break
            else:
                result.append(word)

        return ' '.join(result)
