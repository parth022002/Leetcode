169. Majority Element 
Explaination:

This Python code defines a solution for finding the majority element in a list of integers.

1. The `majorityElement` function takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the majority element, which is an element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times, where n is the length of the list.

2. The length of the input list `nums` is stored in variable `n`.

3. A `defaultdict` named `m` is created to store the count of occurrences of each integer in the input list. This dictionary maps each integer to its count.

4. A loop iterates through each element in the input list:

   - For each element `num`, its count is incremented in the `m` dictionary.

5. After counting all occurrences, the variable `n` is updated to represent half the length of the list (`n // 2`), which is the threshold for determining the majority element.

6. Another loop iterates through each key-value pair in the `m` dictionary:

   - For each key-value pair, if the value (count of occurrences) is greater than `n`, it means the key (integer) is the majority element.
   
   - In this case, the majority element (key) is returned.
   
7. If no majority element is found, the function returns 0.

This algorithm efficiently determines the majority element in the given list of integers using a dictionary to count occurrences. If a majority element exists, it returns that element; otherwise, it returns 0.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        m = defaultdict(int)

        for num in nums:
            m[num] += 1

        n = n // 2
        for key, value in m.items():
            if value > n:
                return key

        return 0
