175. Combine Two Tables
Explaination:

Your MySQL query selects the `firstName`, `lastName`, `city`, and `state` columns from the `Person` table and the `Address` table using a LEFT JOIN operation on the `personId` column.

Here's the query:

```mysql
SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state 
FROM Person 
LEFT JOIN Address USING(personId);
```

This query fetches data from two tables, `Person` and `Address`, using a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all records from the `Person` table are returned, regardless of whether there is a corresponding record in the `Address` table. The `USING` clause is used to specify the column used for joining, simplifying the query when the columns have the same name in both tables.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please feel free to ask!

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address USING(personId);
