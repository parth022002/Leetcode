196.Delete Duplicate Emails
Explaination:

This MySQL query deletes duplicate records from the `Person` table based on their email addresses and IDs. It deletes the records where there is another record with the same email address but a lower ID, keeping only the record with the lowest ID for each unique email.

Here's the breakdown:

```sql
DELETE p1
```
- This specifies the table alias `p1` to be deleted from.

```sql
FROM Person p1
```
- This specifies the `Person` table and aliases it as both `p1` and `p2`.

```sql
INNER JOIN Person p2
```
- This joins the `Person` table to itself using the `INNER JOIN` operation, creating a self-join.

```sql
WHERE p1.email = p2.email 
AND p1.id > p2.id;
```
- This condition specifies that rows should be deleted from `p1` if there exists another row (`p2`) with the same email address (`p1.email = p2.email`) but a lower ID (`p1.id > p2.id`).

Overall, this query deletes duplicate records from the `Person` table, keeping only the record with the lowest ID for each unique email address.
