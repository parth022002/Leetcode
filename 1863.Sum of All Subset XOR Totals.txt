1863.Sum of All Subset XOR Totals
Explanation:

The `subsetXORSum` function is designed to calculate the sum of XOR values of all subsets of a given list of integers, `nums`. Here's an explanation of how the function works and why it uses bitwise operations in this specific way.

### Problem Description:
Given an array of integers, the task is to find the sum of the XOR of all subsets of the array.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding XOR in Subsets:**
   - For an array `nums`, we need to calculate the XOR for each possible subset and then sum these XOR values.
   - If the array has `n` elements, there are `2^n` possible subsets (including the empty subset).
   - The XOR of an empty subset is 0, but we need to consider all non-empty subsets.

2. **Observation with Bitwise OR:**
   - When calculating the XOR of all subsets, each bit position (from the binary representation of the numbers) is important.
   - Each bit in the numbers can be either 0 or 1, and we are interested in how often a bit is set to 1 in the subset XORs.
   - Each bit can be combined in subsets in such a way that it contributes to the XOR sum multiple times.

3. **Using Bitwise OR:**
   - The bitwise OR (`|`) of all elements in `nums` gives a number where each bit is set if it is set in at least one number in the array.
   - This result represents the combination of all bits that can appear in any subset XOR.

4. **Multiplier for Subset Contributions:**
   - Each subset contributes to the total sum, and there are `2^(n-1)` subsets for any element in `nums` that includes the bit.
   - Therefore, the total contribution of each bit to the sum is multiplied by `2^(n-1)`.

### Code Breakdown:
```python
class Solution:
    def subsetXORSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for n in nums:
            res = res | n  # Bitwise OR to collect all bits that can appear in any subset XOR
        return res * 2**(len(nums) - 1)  # Each bit contributes to half of the total subsets
```

### Example:
For the array `nums = [1, 2, 3]`:
- The possible subsets are: `[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]`.
- Calculating the XOR for each subset:
  - `[] -> 0`
  - `[1] -> 1`
  - `[2] -> 2`
  - `[3] -> 3`
  - `[1, 2] -> 1 ^ 2 = 3`
  - `[1, 3] -> 1 ^ 3 = 2`
  - `[2, 3] -> 2 ^ 3 = 1`
  - `[1, 2, 3] -> 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`
- Summing these XOR values gives the total sum: `0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 12`.

### Efficiency:
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, because it only involves a single loop through the elements.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

This method leverages the properties of XOR and bitwise operations to efficiently calculate the desired sum, avoiding the need to generate and iterate through all possible subsets explicitly.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def subsetXORSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for n in nums:
            res = res | n
        return res * 2**(len(nums) - 1)
