1251.Average Selling Price
Explaination:

This MySQL query calculates the average price of each product based on the units sold within a specific time range. Here's the breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT p.product_id`: This selects the `product_id` from the `Prices` table.

2. `IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units*price)/SUM(units),2),0) AS average_price`: This calculates the average price for each product. It first multiplies the `units` with the `price` to get the total revenue for each product. Then, it divides this total revenue by the total number of units sold to get the average price per unit. The `ROUND` function is used to round the result to two decimal places. The `IFNULL` function is used to handle cases where there are no units sold (denominator is zero), returning 0 as the average price in such cases.

3. `FROM Prices p`: This specifies the `Prices` table, aliasing it as `p`.

4. `LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u ON p.product_id = u.product_id AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date`: This performs a left join between the `Prices` table (`p`) and the `UnitsSold` table (`u`) based on the `product_id`. It also filters the join condition based on the `purchase_date` falling between the `start_date` and `end_date`.

5. `GROUP BY product_id`: This groups the results by the `product_id`.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT p.product_id, 
       IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units * price) / SUM(units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices p 
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u 
    ON p.product_id = u.product_id 
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

This query calculates the average price for each product based on the units sold within the specified time range, handling cases where there are no units sold by returning 0 as the average price.

Solution:

SELECT p.product_id, 
       IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units * price) / SUM(units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices p 
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u 
    ON p.product_id = u.product_id 
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
