2441.Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its
Explanation:

Certainly! Let's break down the corrected code step by step:

1. **Sorting the list**: `nums.sort()`
   - We start by sorting the list of numbers in ascending order. This will help us in efficiently finding the negative counterpart of each positive number later on.

2. **Initializing variables**: 
   ```python
   n = len(nums)
   max_k = -1
   ```
   - We store the length of the list in `n`. 
   - `max_k` is initialized to `-1`. This variable will keep track of the maximum number that satisfies the condition.

3. **Iterating through the sorted list in reverse**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
   ```
   - We start the loop from `n-1` and go down to `1`, since we want to compare each number with the numbers before it. We stop at `1` because we don't need to compare the first number with any preceding number.

4. **Checking for positive numbers with negative counterparts**:
   ```python
   if nums[i] > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
       max_k = max(max_k, nums[i])
   elif nums[i] > 0 and -nums[i] in nums[:i]:
       max_k = max(max_k, nums[i])
   ```
   - We first check if the current number (`nums[i]`) is positive (`nums[i] > 0`) and if it has a duplicate preceding it (`nums[i] == nums[i-1]`). If both conditions are met, we update `max_k` if necessary.
   - If the above condition is not met, we check if the current number is positive (`nums[i] > 0`) and if its negative counterpart (`-nums[i]`) is present in the part of the list before the current number (`nums[:i]`). If both conditions are met, we update `max_k` if necessary.

5. **Returning the result**:
   ```python
   return max_k
   ```
   - After iterating through the list, we return the maximum number (`max_k`) that satisfies the condition. If no such number is found, `-1` is returned.

This revised implementation ensures that duplicates are handled correctly, and the maximum number satisfying the condition is returned.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] > 0 and -nums[i] in nums:
                return nums[i]
        return -1  # If no such pair found
