1971.Find if Path Exists inin Graph
Explanation:

It looks like you have a Python class `Solution` with a method `validPath` that determines whether there is a valid path from a given source node to a destination node in an undirected graph represented by its edges. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. The `validPath` method takes four parameters:
   - `n`: the number of nodes in the graph.
   - `edges`: a list of edges, where each edge is represented by a pair of nodes `[u, v]`.
   - `source`: the source node from which to start the path.
   - `destination`: the destination node to reach.

2. Inside the method, a defaultdict `graph` is created to represent the graph. Each key in the dictionary represents a node, and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent nodes.

3. The edges are added to the graph by iterating through the list of edges and appending the adjacent nodes to the appropriate keys in the `graph`.

4. The method `dfs` (depth-first search) is defined to recursively search for a valid path from the source node to the destination node. It takes two parameters:
   - `node`: the current node being visited.
   - `visited`: a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid infinite loops.

5. If the current `node` equals the `destination`, the method returns `True`, indicating that a valid path has been found.

6. Otherwise, the `node` is added to the `visited` set to mark it as visited.

7. The method then recursively calls itself for each neighbor of the current `node` that has not been visited yet. If any of these recursive calls return `True`, indicating a valid path, the method returns `True`.

8. If no valid path is found after exploring all neighbors, the method returns `False`.

9. Finally, the `validPath` method is called with the `source` node and an empty set `visited`, and the result is returned.

Overall, the code effectively uses depth-first search to determine whether there is a valid path from the source to the destination node in the given graph.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def validPath(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        def dfs(node, visited):
            if node == destination:
                return True
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    if dfs(neighbor, visited):
                        return True
            return False
        
        visited = set()
        return dfs(source, visited)
