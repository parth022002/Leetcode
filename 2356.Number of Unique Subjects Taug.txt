2356.Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher
Explaination:

Your MySQL query retrieves the count of distinct subject IDs taught by each teacher. Here's the breakdown:

1. `SELECT teacher_id`: This selects the `teacher_id` column from the `Teacher` table.

2. `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt`: This counts the distinct `subject_id` values for each teacher. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each subject is counted only once for each teacher.

3. `FROM Teacher`: This specifies the `Teacher` table.

4. `GROUP BY teacher_id`: This groups the results by the `teacher_id`.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT teacher_id,
       COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```

This query provides the count of distinct subject IDs taught by each teacher, grouped by the teacher's ID.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select  teacher_id ,
