626.Exchange Seats
Explaination:

This MySQL query assigns seats to students based on certain conditions. Here's the breakdown:

```sql
SELECT CASE
           WHEN s.id % 2 <> 0 AND s.id = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Seat) THEN s.id
```
- This part of the `CASE` statement handles the scenario when the seat ID is odd and is the last seat in the table. It selects the current seat ID.

```sql
           WHEN s.id % 2 = 0 THEN s.id - 1
```
- This part handles the scenario when the seat ID is even. It assigns the previous seat ID to the student.

```sql
           ELSE
               s.id + 1
       END AS id,
```
- This part handles the default scenario, where the seat ID is odd but not the last seat. It assigns the next seat ID to the student.

```sql
       student
```
- This selects the `student` column from the `Seat` table.

```sql
FROM Seat AS s
```
- This specifies the `Seat` table and aliases it as `s`.

```sql
ORDER BY id
```
- This orders the result set by the assigned seat ID.

Overall, this query assigns seats to students based on certain conditions, ensuring that each student is assigned a seat following specific rules.
