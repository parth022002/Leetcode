9. Palindrome number 

Explaination:

This Python code is a solution to determine whether a given integer `x` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The function `isPalindrome` takes an integer `x` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `x` is a palindrome.

2. If `x` is less than 0, the function returns `False` since negative numbers cannot be palindromes.

3. The variable `div` is initialized to 1. This variable is used to find the divisor needed to extract the leftmost digit of `x` later in the code.

4. The first while loop calculates the divisor `div` such that it is greater than the number `x`. It does this by multiplying `div` by 10 until it exceeds `x`.

5. After finding the divisor `div`, the code enters a second while loop that executes as long as `x` is non-zero. This loop checks each pair of digits from the leftmost and rightmost ends of `x`.

6. Inside the loop, it extracts the rightmost digit of `x` using the modulo operator `%` and stores it in the variable `right`. It extracts the leftmost digit of `x` using integer division `//` by `div` and stores it in the variable `left`.

7. It then compares the leftmost and rightmost digits. If they are not equal, it returns `False` indicating that `x` is not a palindrome.

8. If the leftmost and rightmost digits are equal, it removes these two digits from `x` by using the modulo operator `%` to get rid of the leftmost digit and then integer division `//` by 10 to shift the remaining digits to the right.

9. It also adjusts the divisor `div` by dividing it by 100 since two digits have been removed from `x`.

10. The loop continues until `x` becomes zero, which means all digits have been compared and found to be equal.

11. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all pairs of digits were equal, and the number is a palindrome. In this case, it returns `True`.

Overall, this algorithm efficiently checks whether an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string. It has a time complexity of O(log10(n)), where n is the value of the integer `x`.

Solution:

	class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        div = 1
        while x >= 10*div:
            div *= 10
        
        while x:
            right = x%10
            left = x//div

            if left != right:
                return False

            x = (x%div) // 10
            div = div / 100
        return True
