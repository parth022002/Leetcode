620.Not Boring Movies
Explaination:

This MySQL query selects data from the `Cinema` table where the `id` is odd (`id%2=1`) and the `description` is not equal to 'boring', ordering the results by `rating` in descending order. Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT *`: This selects all columns from the `Cinema` table.

2. `FROM Cinema`: This specifies the `Cinema` table.

3. `WHERE id%2=1`: This condition filters the rows where the `id` is odd (`id % 2 = 1`).

4. `AND description <> 'boring'`: This condition filters out rows where the `description` is equal to 'boring'.

5. `ORDER BY rating DESC`: This orders the results by the `rating` column in descending order.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Cinema 
WHERE id % 2 = 1 
AND description <> 'boring' 
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

This query retrieves data from the `Cinema` table where the `id` is odd and the `description` is not 'boring', sorted by `rating` in descending order.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select * from Cinema where id%2=1  and description <> 'boring'order by rating desc;
