995.Minimum Number of K consecutive Bit Flips
Explanation:

The given code is an implementation of a function that finds the minimum number of flips required to convert all elements of an array `nums` to 1s using a sliding window of size `k`. If it's not possible to achieve this, the function returns -1. Let's break down the code step by step:

### Code Breakdown

1. **Function Signature and Initial Setup:**
   ```python
   class Solution:
       def minKBitFlips(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
           n = len(nums)
           flipped = [0] * n
           current_flips = 0
           flip_count = 0
   ```
   - The function `minKBitFlips` takes two parameters: `nums`, a list of integers (0s and 1s), and `k`, the size of the sliding window for flips.
   - `n` is the length of the `nums` list.
   - `flipped` is an array of the same length as `nums`, initialized to 0, used to keep track of where flips occur.
   - `current_flips` keeps track of the cumulative number of flips within the current window.
   - `flip_count` is the total number of flips performed.

2. **Iterating Through the Array:**
   ```python
           for i in range(n):
               if i >= k:
                   current_flips ^= flipped[i - k]
   ```
   - The loop iterates through each element in the `nums` array.
   - When `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the window can start to move. The flip status (`flipped[i - k]`) of the element that is `k` steps behind the current position is removed from `current_flips` using the XOR operation (`^=`).

3. **Determining the Need for a Flip:**
   ```python
               if (nums[i] == 0 and current_flips % 2 == 0) or (nums[i] == 1 and current_flips % 2 != 0):
                   if i + k > n:
                       return -1
   ```
   - The condition checks if the current bit needs to be flipped:
     - If `nums[i]` is 0 and the number of flips so far (`current_flips`) is even, we need to flip.
     - If `nums[i]` is 1 and the number of flips so far is odd, we also need to flip.
   - If flipping starting from index `i` would exceed the bounds of the array (`i + k > n`), it's impossible to flip a window of size `k`, and the function returns -1.

4. **Performing the Flip:**
   ```python
                   flipped[i] = 1
                   current_flips += 1
                   flip_count += 1
   ```
   - If a flip is needed and valid, the current position `i` in the `flipped` array is set to 1, indicating a flip starts here.
   - `current_flips` is incremented to account for the new flip.
   - `flip_count`, which tracks the total number of flips performed, is incremented.

5. **Return the Total Number of Flips:**
   ```python
           return flip_count
   ```
   - After iterating through the entire array, the function returns the total number of flips performed (`flip_count`).

### Summary

- The function iterates through the `nums` array and decides whether a flip is needed based on the current value and the number of flips applied so far.
- It uses an auxiliary array `flipped` to keep track of the flips and a variable `current_flips` to manage the cumulative number of flips within the window.
- If a flip is required but not possible within the array bounds, the function returns -1.
- The function aims to achieve the goal with the minimum number of flips and returns this count if successful.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def minKBitFlips(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        flipped = [0] * n
        current_flips = 0
        flip_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i >= k:
                current_flips ^= flipped[i - k]
            
            if (nums[i] == 0 and current_flips % 2 == 0) or (nums[i] == 1 and current_flips % 2 != 0):
                if i + k > n:
                    return -1
                
                flipped[i] = 1
                current_flips += 1
                flip_count += 1
        
        return flip_count
