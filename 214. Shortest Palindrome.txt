### Explanation of the Solution:

The task is to find the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters only at the beginning of a given string `s`. The algorithm uses the concept of the "Longest Prefix Suffix" (LPS) array from the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) pattern matching algorithm. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. **Check for Edge Cases**:
   - The first check `if not s or s == s[::-1]` handles edge cases:
     - If the string `s` is empty, it is already a palindrome.
     - If `s` is already a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards), return `s` immediately since no additional characters are needed.

2. **Create a Temporary String**:
   - We create a new string `temp` by concatenating the original string `s`, a special separator character `"#"`, and the reverse of `s`. The separator ensures that there is no overlap between the original and the reversed parts.
   - For example, if `s = "aacecaaa"`, then `temp = "aacecaaa#aaacecaa"`.

3. **Compute the LPS Array**:
   - The LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array helps in finding the longest substring that is both a prefix and a suffix of the combined string `temp`. This tells us the longest palindromic prefix of the original string `s`.
   - We initialize an LPS array with zeros, `lps = [0] * len(temp)`, where each index will store the length of the longest prefix of the substring ending at that index, which is also a suffix.

4. **Populate the LPS Array**:
   - Loop through each character of `temp`, starting from index 1:
     - Let `j` be the length of the previous longest prefix suffix (starting as `lps[i - 1]`).
     - Use a while loop to reduce `j` if the characters at positions `i` and `j` do not match (`temp[i] != temp[j]`). This step allows us to find the longest matching prefix-suffix length.
     - If the characters `temp[i]` and `temp[j]` match, increment `j` (`j += 1`).
     - Set `lps[i]` to `j`, which now represents the longest prefix-suffix length ending at index `i`.

5. **Determine the Characters to Add**:
   - The last value in the LPS array (`lps[-1]`) represents the length of the longest palindromic prefix in the original string `s`.
   - Extract the substring from `s` that is not part of this palindromic prefix (`s[lps[-1]:]`), reverse it, and add it to the start of `s`. This forms the shortest palindrome.
   - For example, if `s = "abcd"`, then `lps[-1] = 0`, and `s[lps[-1]:] = "abcd"`, so we add the reverse of this substring (`"dcba"`) to the start of `s`, resulting in `"dcbabcd"`.

6. **Return the Shortest Palindrome**:
   - Finally, return the modified string with the added characters, which is the shortest palindrome.

### Example Walkthrough:

1. For `s = "aacecaaa"`:
   - `temp = "aacecaaa#aaacecaa"`.
   - LPS array calculation gives `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - `lps[-1] = 7`, indicating that the longest palindromic prefix is `"aacecaaa"`.
   - No additional characters are needed, so the output is `"aaacecaaa"`.

2. For `s = "abcd"`:
   - `temp = "abcd#dcba"`.
   - LPS array calculation gives `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `lps[-1] = 0`, indicating no palindromic prefix.
   - Add the reverse of `"abcd"`, resulting in `"dcbabcd"`.

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it well-suited for long strings.
