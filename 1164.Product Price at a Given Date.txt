1164.Product Price at a Given Date
Explaination:

This MySQL query combines the results of two SELECT statements using the UNION operator. The first SELECT statement retrieves products with a fixed price of 10 from the `Products` table where the `change_date` is not before or equal to '2019-08-16' for any record with the same `product_id`. The second SELECT statement retrieves products with their most recent price (`new_price`) where the `change_date` is not before or equal to '2019-08-16'.

Here's the breakdown:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE product_id NOT IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT product_id
     FROM Products
     WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16')
```

Explanation:
- This part selects distinct `product_id` with a fixed price of 10 where the `change_date` is not before or equal to '2019-08-16' for any record with the same `product_id`.

```sql
UNION
```

- This keyword combines the results of two SELECT statements.

```sql
SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
FROM Products
WHERE (product_id, change_date) IN
    (SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date) AS date
     FROM Products
     WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
     GROUP BY product_id)
```

Explanation:
- This part selects `product_id` and its corresponding `new_price` where the combination of `product_id` and `change_date` matches the most recent `change_date` (maximum) for each `product_id` not before or equal to '2019-08-16'.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE product_id NOT IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT product_id
     FROM Products
     WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16')
UNION
SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
FROM Products
WHERE (product_id, change_date) IN
    (SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date) AS date
     FROM Products
     WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
     GROUP BY product_id)
