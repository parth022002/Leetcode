1075.Project Employees I
Explaination:

This MySQL query calculates the average years of experience of employees assigned to each project. Here's the breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT p.project_id`: This selects the `project_id` from the `Project` table.

2. `ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years`: This calculates the average years of experience for each project. It computes the average of the `experience_years` column from the `Employee` table for employees assigned to each project. The `ROUND` function is used to round the result to two decimal places.

3. `FROM Project p`: This specifies the `Project` table, aliasing it as `p`.

4. `LEFT JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id`: This performs a left join between the `Project` table (`p`) and the `Employee` table (`e`) based on the `employee_id`. This links employees to their respective projects.

5. `GROUP BY p.project_id`: This groups the results by the `project_id`.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT p.project_id, 
       ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p 
LEFT JOIN Employee e 
    ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```

This query calculates the average years of experience for employees assigned to each project and presents the results grouped by project ID.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years
FROM Project p 
LEFT JOIN Employee e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id
