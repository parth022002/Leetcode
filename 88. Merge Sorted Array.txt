88. Merge Sorted Array
Explaination:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `merge` that merges two sorted lists `num1` and `num2` into `num1`, assuming `num1` has enough space to accommodate all elements from `num2`.

Here's how the code works:

1. It calculates the index of the last element of the merged list as `last = m + n - 1`, where `m` is the length of `num1` and `n` is the length of `num2`.

2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as there are elements remaining in both lists (`m > 0` and `n > 0`).

3. Inside the loop, it compares the last elements of both lists (`num1[m - 1]` and `num2[n - 1]`):
   - If the last element of `num1` is greater than the last element of `num2`, it places the last element of `num1` at the position `last` in `num1`, and decrements `m` by 1 to move to the next element in `num1`.
   - Otherwise, it places the last element of `num2` at the position `last` in `num1`, and decrements `n` by 1 to move to the next element in `num2`.
   - In either case, it decrements `last` by 1 to move towards the start of `num1`.

4. After the loop, if there are still elements remaining in `num2` (i.e., `n > 0`), it copies the remaining elements of `num2` into `num1`, starting from the `last` index and moving towards the start of `num1`.

This code efficiently merges two sorted lists into `num1` in-place by comparing elements from the end of both lists and placing the larger element at the end of `num1`. It then copies any remaining elements from `num2` into `num1`. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m + n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`, respectively.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def merge(self, num1: List[int], m: int, num2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        last = m + n - 1

        while m > 0 and n > 0:
            if num1[m - 1] > num2[n - 1]:
                num1[last] = num1[m - 1]
                m -= 1
            else:
                num1[last] = num2[n - 1]
                n -= 1
            last -= 1

        while n > 0:
            num1[last] = num2[n - 1]
            n, last = n -1, last -1
