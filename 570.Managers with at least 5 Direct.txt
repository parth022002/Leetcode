570.Managers with at least 5 Direct Reports
Explaination:

This MySQL query selects the names of employees who are managers and have at least five employees reporting to them. Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT m.name`: This selects the name of the managers.

2. `FROM employee AS e INNER JOIN employee AS m ON e.managerId = m.id`: This performs an inner join on the `employee` table, matching the manager ID (`m.id`) of each employee (`e`) with the ID of their corresponding manager. This self-join links employees with their managers.

3. `GROUP BY e.managerId`: This groups the result by the manager's ID.

4. `HAVING COUNT(e.id) >= 5`: This filters the groups, selecting only those where the count of employees reporting to the manager (count of `e.id`) is greater than or equal to 5.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT m.name
FROM employee AS e
INNER JOIN employee AS m ON e.managerId = m.id
GROUP BY e.managerId
HAVING COUNT(e.id) >= 5;
```

This query retrieves the names of managers who have at least five employees reporting to them.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select m.name
from employee as e
inner join employee as m
on e.managerId=m.id
group by e.managerId 
having count(e.id)>=5
