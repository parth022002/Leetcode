1327.List the Products Ordered in a Period
Explaination:

This MySQL query retrieves the product names and the total units ordered for products that meet the specified conditions (ordered in February 2020 and with a total unit count greater than or equal to 100). Here's the breakdown of the query:

```sql
SELECT p.product_name AS product_name, SUM(o.unit) AS unit
```
- This selects the `product_name` from the `Products` table (aliased as `p`) and the sum of units from the `Orders` table (aliased as `o`).

```sql
FROM Products p
JOIN Orders o USING (product_id)
```
- This specifies that the data is retrieved by joining the `Products` and `Orders` tables using the `product_id` column.

```sql
WHERE YEAR(o.order_date) = '2020' AND MONTH(o.order_date) = '02'
```
- This condition filters the rows to include only those where the `order_date` falls within February 2020.

```sql
GROUP BY p.product_id
```
- This groups the results by the `product_id`, ensuring that the aggregation functions (`SUM`) are applied per unique product.

```sql
HAVING SUM(o.unit) >= 100
```
- This further filters the grouped results to include only those products whose total unit count is greater than or equal to 100.

Overall, this query retrieves the product names and total units ordered for products meeting the specified conditions.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT p.product_name AS product_name, sum(o.unit) AS unit FROM Products p
JOIN Orders o USING (product_id)
WHERE YEAR(o.order_date)='2020' AND MONTH(o.order_date)='02'
GROUP BY p.product_id
HAVING SUM(o.unit)>=100
