729. My Calendar I
Solution:

class MyCalendar:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the slots in the calendar
        self.slots = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        # The index of this time slots if it is booked
        index = bisect.bisect_left(self.slots, (start, end))
        res = True

        # Check the next time slot 
        # which will be the current index if it is existed
        if index < len(self.slots): res &= end <= self.slots[index][0]
        
        # Check the previous time slot 
        # which will be the index - 1 if it is existed  
        if index - 1 >= 0: res &= start >= self.slots[index-1][1]

        # Only insert if it satisfied previous and next time slot
        if res: bisect.insort_left(self.slots, (start, end))
        return res

Explanation:

Your `MyCalendar` class is a calendar booking system that checks for overlapping time slots. Here's an explanation of how it works:

### Class Breakdown

#### `__init__` Method
This method initializes an empty list `self.slots`, which will store the booked time slots as tuples of `(start, end)` values. Each tuple represents a booking where `start` is the starting time and `end` is the ending time of the booked slot.

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.slots = []
```

---

#### `book` Method
The `book` method attempts to add a new time slot (`start`, `end`) to the calendar. It returns `True` if the time slot can be added without overlapping with existing slots, otherwise it returns `False`.

1. **Find Insertion Point:**
   ```python
   index = bisect.bisect_left(self.slots, (start, end))
   ```
   - `bisect.bisect_left` is used to find the position (`index`) where the new time slot `(start, end)` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `self.slots`. This ensures the list remains sorted as you add more bookings.
   
2. **Check Next Time Slot:**
   ```python
   if index < len(self.slots): res &= end <= self.slots[index][0]
   ```
   - After finding the insertion point, the next step is to check if the new time slot overlaps with the next existing slot in the list (i.e., the slot at `self.slots[index]`).
   - The condition `end <= self.slots[index][0]` checks if the end time of the new booking is less than or equal to the start time of the next slot. If this condition holds, it means there is no overlap with the next slot.
   
3. **Check Previous Time Slot:**
   ```python
   if index - 1 >= 0: res &= start >= self.slots[index-1][1]
   ```
   - Similarly, this checks for overlap with the previous time slot (i.e., the slot at `self.slots[index-1]`).
   - The condition `start >= self.slots[index-1][1]` checks if the start time of the new booking is greater than or equal to the end time of the previous slot. If this condition holds, there is no overlap with the previous slot.
   
4. **Insert New Time Slot:**
   ```python
   if res: bisect.insort_left(self.slots, (start, end))
   ```
   - If both conditions (for next and previous slots) are satisfied, meaning thereâ€™s no overlap, the new time slot is inserted into `self.slots` at the correct position using `bisect.insort_left`, which maintains the sorted order.
   
5. **Return Result:**
   ```python
   return res
   ```
   - The method returns `True` if the slot was successfully booked (i.e., no overlaps), or `False` if overlaps occurred.

---

### Example:
Let's say you have an empty calendar and try to book the following time slots:

- First booking: `(10, 20)`
  - No existing bookings, so it is successfully added.
  
- Second booking: `(15, 25)`
  - This overlaps with the first booking because `15 < 20`. Hence, it will not be booked, and the method will return `False`.

- Third booking: `(20, 30)`
  - This does not overlap with the first booking since `20 == 20` (end time of the first booking matches the start time of the new one). So it is successfully added.

---

### Conclusion:
The class efficiently handles time slot bookings while maintaining a sorted list of booked slots and ensuring no overlaps between bookings using binary search (`bisect`).
