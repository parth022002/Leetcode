1480.Running Sum of 1d Array
Explanation:

The provided code defines a class `Solution` with a method `runningSum` that takes a list of integers `nums` and returns a list where each element is the running sum of the corresponding elements in the input list `nums`.

Here's how the code works:

1. It initializes a variable `a` to store the running sum, initially set to 0.
2. It initializes an empty list `lst` to store the running sums.
3. It iterates over each element `i` in the input list `nums`.
4. For each element `i`, it adds `i` to the running sum `a` and appends the updated running sum to the list `lst`.
5. Finally, it returns the list `lst` containing the running sums.

This code is straightforward and correctly computes the running sum of the input list. There are no apparent issues with this implementation. It efficiently computes the running sum using a single pass through the input list.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        a = 0
        lst = []
        for i in nums:
            a = a + i
            lst.append(a)
        return lst
