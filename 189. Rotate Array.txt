189. Rotate Array
Explanation:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `rotate` that rotates the elements of a list `nums` to the right by `k` steps. Let's break down the method:

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        k = k % len(nums)
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1

        l, r = 0, k -1
        while l < r:
            nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1
        
        l, r = k, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1
```

1. `rotate` takes two parameters: `nums`, which is a list of integers, and `k`, which is the number of steps to rotate the list to the right.

2. It first calculates `k` modulo the length of the `nums` list. This ensures that `k` is within the range of valid indices.

3. It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` at the beginning and end of the `nums` list respectively.

4. It enters a while loop where `l` is less than `r`, indicating that there are still elements between the two pointers. Inside this loop:
   - It swaps the elements at positions `l` and `r` in the `nums` list.
   - It increments `l` by 1 and decrements `r` by 1.

5. After the first loop, it initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `k - 1` respectively, indicating the range of elements that need to be rotated in the first part of the list.

6. It enters another while loop to swap elements within this range, similar to the first loop.

7. After the second loop, it initializes `l` and `r` to `k` and `len(nums) - 1` respectively, indicating the range of elements that need to be rotated in the second part of the list.

8. It enters a third while loop to swap elements within this range, similar to the previous loops.

9. Since the method signature specifies `-> None`, the function does not return anything explicitly, but it modifies the `nums` list in place, effectively rotating its elements to the right by `k` steps.

Overall, this method effectively rotates the elements of the `nums` list to the right by `k` steps using a three-step approach: reversing the entire list, then reversing the first `k` elements, and finally reversing the remaining elements.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        k = k % len(nums)
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1

        l, r = 0, k -1
        while l < r:
            nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1
        
        l, r = k, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1
