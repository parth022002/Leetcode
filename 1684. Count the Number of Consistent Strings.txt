Explanation:

Let's break down the solution step-by-step to explain how it works:

### Problem Recap

The goal is to count the number of strings in the list `words` that are "consistent" with the `allowed` string. A string is considered consistent if all its characters appear in the `allowed` string.

### Explanation of the Code

#### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Convert `allowed` to a Set:**
   ```python
   allowed_set = set(allowed)
   ```
   - The `allowed` string is converted to a set called `allowed_set`.
   - This conversion is important because sets in Python provide O(1) average time complexity for membership checks (i.e., checking if a character is in the set).

2. **Initialize Counter for Consistent Strings:**
   ```python
   consistent_count = 0
   ```
   - We initialize a counter `consistent_count` to keep track of the number of consistent strings.

3. **Iterate Over Each Word in `words`:**
   ```python
   for word in words:
   ```
   - We loop through each word in the `words` list.

4. **Check Consistency for Each Word:**
   ```python
   if set(word).issubset(allowed_set):
       consistent_count += 1
   ```
   - For each word, we convert it into a set using `set(word)`. This allows us to quickly check all unique characters in the word.
   - The method `issubset()` checks if all elements (characters) in `set(word)` are also in `allowed_set`. If this is true, it means that the word is consistent with the `allowed` string.
   - If the word is consistent, we increment the `consistent_count` by 1.

5. **Return the Count of Consistent Strings:**
   ```python
   return consistent_count
   ```
   - After iterating through all the words, we return the final count of consistent strings.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through one of the examples to see how the code works:

- **Input:**
  ```python
  allowed = "abc"
  words = ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]
  ```

- **Step 1:** Convert `allowed` to a set:
  ```python
  allowed_set = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
  ```

- **Step 2:** Initialize `consistent_count` to 0.

- **Step 3:** Loop through each word in `words`:
  - **Word "a":**
    - `set("a")` is `{'a'}`. Check if `{'a'}` is a subset of `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
    - It is, so increment `consistent_count` to 1.
  - **Word "b":**
    - `set("b")` is `{'b'}`. Check if `{'b'}` is a subset of `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
    - It is, so increment `consistent_count` to 2.
  - **Word "c":**
    - `set("c")` is `{'c'}`. Check if `{'c'}` is a subset of `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
    - It is, so increment `consistent_count` to 3.
  - **Word "ab":**
    - `set("ab")` is `{'a', 'b'}`. Check if `{'a', 'b'}` is a subset of `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
    - It is, so increment `consistent_count` to 4.
  - **Word "ac":**
    - `set("ac")` is `{'a', 'c'}`. Check if `{'a', 'c'}` is a subset of `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
    - It is, so increment `consistent_count` to 5.
  - **Word "bc":**
    - `set("bc")` is `{'b', 'c'}`. Check if `{'b', 'c'}` is a subset of `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
    - It is, so increment `consistent_count` to 6.
  - **Word "abc":**
    - `set("abc")` is `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`. Check if `{'a', 'b', 'c'}` is a subset of `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
    - It is, so increment `consistent_count` to 7.

- **Final Output:**
  ```python
  return 7
  ```
  - All 7 words are consistent with the `allowed` string.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity: O(n * m),** where:
  - `n` is the number of words in the `words` list.
  - `m` is the average length of the words in the list.
- The `issubset` operation checks if all elements of one set are in another set, which is efficient for this problem size.

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**, considering that the size of `allowed_set` is at most 26 (for lowercase English letters). The additional space used for converting each word to a set is temporary and does not affect the overall space complexity significantly.

This solution efficiently handles the problem requirements and ensures minimal runtime with an optimal approach.
