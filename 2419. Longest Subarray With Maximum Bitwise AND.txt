### Explanation of the Code

This Python function is designed to solve the problem of finding the longest subarray where all elements are equal to the **maximum value** in the array. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Finding the Maximum Value (`max_val`)**:
   ```python
   max_val = max(nums)
   ```
   - The first step is to find the **maximum value** in the `nums` array using the built-in `max()` function. This value will be denoted as `max_val`.
   - For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2]`, the maximum value is `3`.

2. **Initializing Tracking Variables**:
   ```python
   longest = 0
   current_len = 0
   ```
   - Two variables are initialized:
     - `longest`: This keeps track of the **longest subarray** found so far where every element is equal to `max_val`.
     - `current_len`: This tracks the **length of the current subarray** where all elements are equal to `max_val` as we iterate through `nums`.

3. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   ```python
   for num in nums:
   ```
   - This loop iterates through each element (`num`) in the `nums` array to process them one by one.

4. **Checking for Maximum Value (`num == max_val`)**:
   ```python
   if num == max_val:
       current_len += 1
       if current_len > longest:
           longest = current_len
   ```
   - For each element `num`, the code checks whether `num` is equal to `max_val`. 
   - If it is, the current subarray is extended by incrementing `current_len` by 1.
   - The code then checks if the length of the current subarray (`current_len`) is the longest found so far, updating `longest` if necessary.

5. **Handling Elements Not Equal to `max_val`**:
   ```python
   else:
       current_len = 0
   ```
   - If the element `num` is **not equal to `max_val`,** the current subarray ends, so `current_len` is reset to `0`.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   ```python
   return longest
   ```
   - After the loop completes, the function returns `longest`, which holds the length of the longest subarray where all elements are equal to the maximum value in `nums`.

### **Example Walkthrough**:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2]`

- The maximum value is `3`.
- The subarrays with the value `3` are `[3, 3]` (of length 2).
- The function returns `2`, as `[3, 3]` is the longest subarray where the bitwise AND equals the maximum value.

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

- The maximum value is `4`.
- The only subarray containing the value `4` is `[4]` (of length 1).
- The function returns `1`.

---

### **Time Complexity**:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because the array is traversed once to find the maximum value and once again to find the longest subarray.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
