1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced
Solution:

class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = count = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == 'b':
                count += 1
            elif count:
                res += 1
                count -= 1
        return res

Explanation:

Sure, let's break down the code and explain how it works.

### Problem Statement
The task is to find the minimum number of deletions required to make a given string `s` balanced. A string is considered balanced if there are no 'a' characters before any 'b' characters. In other words, all 'a's should come before all 'b's.

### Code Explanation

Here's the provided solution again for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = count = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == 'b':
                count += 1
            elif count:
                res += 1
                count -= 1
        return res
```

Now, let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   res = count = 0
   ```
   - `res` is used to keep track of the number of deletions needed.
   - `count` is used to keep track of the number of 'b's encountered so far.

2. **Loop through the string**:
   ```python
   for c in s:
   ```
   This loop iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.

3. **Check if the character is 'b'**:
   ```python
   if c == 'b':
       count += 1
   ```
   - If the character is 'b', increment the `count` by 1. This keeps track of how many 'b's have been seen.

4. **Check if the character is 'a' and there are previous 'b's**:
   ```python
   elif count:
       res += 1
       count -= 1
   ```
   - If the character is 'a' and there are one or more 'b's before it (i.e., `count` is greater than 0), it means we have to remove this 'a' to make the string balanced.
   - Increment `res` by 1 to count this deletion.
   - Decrement `count` by 1 because one 'b' can now be "paired" with this 'a' (conceptually thinking of it as removing this 'a' to balance the sequence).

5. **Return the result**:
   ```python
   return res
   ```
   - After the loop finishes, `res` contains the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string balanced.

### Example

Let's go through an example to understand the flow:

Suppose the input string is `s = "aababbab"`.

- Start: `res = 0`, `count = 0`
- Iteration 1: `c = 'a'`
  - `count = 0`, nothing changes.
- Iteration 2: `c = 'a'`
  - `count = 0`, nothing changes.
- Iteration 3: `c = 'b'`
  - `count += 1` -> `count = 1`
- Iteration 4: `c = 'a'`
  - `count > 0`, so `res += 1` -> `res = 1`
  - `count -= 1` -> `count = 0`
- Iteration 5: `c = 'b'`
  - `count += 1` -> `count = 1`
- Iteration 6: `c = 'b'`
  - `count += 1` -> `count = 2`
- Iteration 7: `c = 'a'`
  - `count > 0`, so `res += 1` -> `res = 2`
  - `count -= 1` -> `count = 1`
- Iteration 8: `c = 'b'`
  - `count += 1` -> `count = 2`

Final values: `res = 2`, `count = 2`

Thus, the minimum number of deletions required to make the string "aababbab" balanced is 2.
