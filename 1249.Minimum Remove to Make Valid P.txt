1249.Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses
Explaination:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minRemoveToMakeValid`, which takes a string `s` as input and returns a modified string. The goal of the method is to remove the minimum number of parentheses from the string `s` to make it a valid string. A string is considered valid if for every open parenthesis '(' there is a corresponding closing parenthesis ')', and the parentheses are properly nested.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. It initializes a counter `openParenthesesCount` to keep track of the number of open parentheses encountered.
2. It converts the input string `s` into a list `arr`.
3. It iterates through each character in the list `arr` using a for loop.
   - If the character is an open parenthesis '(', it increments `openParenthesesCount`.
   - If the character is a closing parenthesis ')':
     - If there are no corresponding open parentheses encountered before, it replaces the closing parenthesis with '*' to mark it for removal.
     - Otherwise, it decrements `openParenthesesCount` to match the closing parenthesis with an open one.
4. It iterates through the list in reverse order.
   - If there are still unmatched open parentheses left (`openParenthesesCount > 0`) and encounters an open parenthesis, it replaces it with '*' and decrements `openParenthesesCount`.
5. Finally, it joins all characters in the modified list `arr`, excluding the '*' characters, and returns the resulting string.

The code effectively removes the minimum number of parentheses required to make the input string valid.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        openParenthesesCount = 0
        arr = list(s)

        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == '(':
                openParenthesesCount +=1
            elif arr[i] == ')':
                if openParenthesesCount == 0:
                    arr[i] = '*'
                else:
                    openParenthesesCount -= 1

        for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
            if openParenthesesCount > 0 and arr[i] == '(':
                arr[i] = '*'
                openParenthesesCount -= 1

        return ''.join ( c for c in arr if c != '*')
