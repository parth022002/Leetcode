412.Fizz Buzz
Explanation:

The provided code defines a class `Solution` with a method `fizzBuzz` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of strings based on the following rules:

- If the number is divisible by 3, the string "Fizz" is added to the list.
- If the number is divisible by 5, the string "Buzz" is added to the list.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the string "FizzBuzz" is added to the list.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the string representation of the number is added to the list.

Here's how the code works:

1. It initializes an empty list `output` to store the resulting strings.
2. It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a loop.
3. For each number `i`, it checks if it's divisible by 3, by 5, or both.
4. If `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, it appends "FizzBuzz" to the `output` list.
5. If `i` is divisible only by 3, it appends "Fizz" to the `output` list.
6. If `i` is divisible only by 5, it appends "Buzz" to the `output` list.
7. If `i` is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it appends the string representation of `i` to the `output` list.
8. After iterating through all numbers, it returns the `output` list containing the resulting strings.

This implementation correctly follows the rules of the FizzBuzz game and efficiently generates the output list based on the input `n`. There are no apparent issues with this implementation.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        output = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i % 3 == 0:
                ans = "Fizz"
                if i % 5 == 0:
                    ans += "Buzz"
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                ans = "Buzz"
            else:
                ans = str(i)
            output.append(ans)
        return output
