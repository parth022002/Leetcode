57.Insert Interval
Explaintion

The provided code defines a class `Solution` with a method `insert`. This method takes two arguments:

1. `intervals`: A list of lists where each inner list represents an interval with two integers `[start, end]`.
2. `newInterval`: A list representing a new interval to insert into the list of intervals.

The method `insert` aims to insert the new interval `newInterval` into the list of intervals `intervals` while merging overlapping intervals if necessary. Let's break down the code:

```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if newInterval[1] < intervals[i][0]:
                # If the end of newInterval is before the start of the current interval,
                # append newInterval and the remaining intervals to the result.
                res.append(newInterval)
                return res + intervals[i:]
            elif newInterval[0] > intervals[i][1]:
                # If the start of newInterval is after the end of the current interval,
                # append the current interval to the result.
                res.append(intervals[i])
            else:
                # If there is an overlap between newInterval and the current interval,
                # update newInterval to cover both intervals.
                newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]), max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])]
        res.append(newInterval)
        return res
```

Explanation of the code:

- The method initializes an empty list `res` to store the resulting intervals.
- It iterates through each interval in the list `intervals`.
- It checks three conditions:
  1. If the end of `newInterval` is before the start of the current interval, it means there's no overlap, so it appends `newInterval` and the remaining intervals to the result.
  2. If the start of `newInterval` is after the end of the current interval, it means `newInterval` comes after the current interval, so it appends the current interval to the result.
  3. If there's an overlap between `newInterval` and the current interval, it updates `newInterval` to cover both intervals.
- After iterating through all intervals, it appends the final `newInterval` to the result.
- The method returns the resulting list of intervals.

The code seems to be a solution to the "Insert Interval" problem, which involves merging overlapping intervals while inserting a new interval into a sorted list of intervals.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if newInterval[1] < intervals[i][0]:
                res.append(newInterval)
                return res + intervals[i:]
            elif newInterval[0] > intervals[i][1]:
                res.append(intervals[i])
            else:
                newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]), max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])]
        res.append(newInterval)
        return res
