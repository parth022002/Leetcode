1789.Primary Department for Each Employee
Explaination:

Certainly! Here's the breakdown of your MySQL query:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR employee_id IN
    (SELECT employee_id
     FROM Employee
     GROUP BY employee_id
     HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1)
```

Explanation:

1. **SELECT statement**:
   - It selects the `employee_id` and `department_id` columns from the `Employee` table.

2. **FROM clause**:
   - It specifies that the data is being retrieved from the `Employee` table.

3. **WHERE clause**:
   - It filters the rows based on certain conditions:
     - `primary_flag = 'Y'`: It selects rows where the `primary_flag` column has a value of 'Y'.
     - `OR`: It allows rows where the `employee_id` is present in the subquery result.
     - Subquery:
       - It selects `employee_id` from the `Employee` table.
       - It groups the rows by `employee_id`.
       - It filters the groups using the `HAVING` clause, selecting only those `employee_id` where the count of distinct `department_id` is 1.

4. **EXPLAIN**:
   - The `EXPLAIN` keyword is used to obtain a query execution plan from the MySQL query optimizer. It provides information about how MySQL executes a SELECT statement.

This query fetches employee IDs and department IDs from the `Employee` table based on two conditions: either the `primary_flag` is 'Y', or the employee belongs to a department where they are the only member (i.e., they are the only one in that department). The `EXPLAIN` keyword is then used to analyze the query execution plan.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employee_id, department_id from Employee
where primary_flag = 'Y' or employee_id in
(select employee_id from Employee 
group by employee_id
having count(department_id) = 1)
