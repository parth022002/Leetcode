Solution:

class Solution:
    def countSeniors(self, details: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for detail in details:
            try:
                # Extract the age from the string
                age = int(detail[11:13])
                # Check if the age is greater than 60
                if age > 60:
                    count += 1
            except ValueError:
                # Handle the case where conversion to int fails
                print(f"Invalid age format in detail: {detail}")
        return count

Explanation:

Sure, let's go through the code step by step:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countSeniors(self, details: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for detail in details:
            try:
                # Extract the age from the string
                age = int(detail[11:13])
                # Check if the age is greater than 60
                if age > 60:
                    count += 1
            except ValueError:
                # Handle the case where conversion to int fails
                print(f"Invalid age format in detail: {detail}")
        return count
```

### Explanation

1. **Importing List**:
   ```python
   from typing import List
   ```
   - This import statement allows us to use `List` for type hinting, making the code more readable and understandable.

2. **Defining the Class**:
   ```python
   class Solution:
   ```
   - This defines a class named `Solution` which contains our method.

3. **Defining the Method**:
   ```python
   def countSeniors(self, details: List[str]) -> int:
   ```
   - This defines a method `countSeniors` that takes a list of strings (`details`) and returns an integer.

4. **Initializing the Counter**:
   ```python
   count = 0
   ```
   - This initializes a variable `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of seniors (people with age > 60).

5. **Looping Through Details**:
   ```python
   for detail in details:
   ```
   - This loop iterates over each string in the `details` list.

6. **Extracting and Checking Age**:
   ```python
   try:
       # Extract the age from the string
       age = int(detail[11:13])
       # Check if the age is greater than 60
       if age > 60:
           count += 1
   except ValueError:
       # Handle the case where conversion to int fails
       print(f"Invalid age format in detail: {detail}")
   ```
   - `try`: This block is used to attempt operations that might cause an error.
   - `age = int(detail[11:13])`: This extracts a substring from `detail` (specifically characters at positions 11 and 12) and converts it to an integer. The assumption here is that these two characters represent the age.
   - `if age > 60`: This checks if the extracted age is greater than 60.
   - `count += 1`: If the age is greater than 60, the `count` is incremented by 1.
   - `except ValueError`: If the conversion to integer fails (for instance, if the substring is not a valid number), this block will execute.
   - `print(f"Invalid age format in detail: {detail}")`: This prints a message indicating that there was an invalid age format in the current `detail`.

7. **Returning the Count**:
   ```python
   return count
   ```
   - After the loop has processed all the strings in `details`, the method returns the value of `count`, which represents the number of seniors found.

### Summary
The method `countSeniors` iterates through a list of strings, extracts the age from each string (assuming it's located at a specific position), and counts how many of these ages are greater than 60. If it encounters a string where the age can't be extracted or isn't in the correct format, it prints an error message and continues with the next string.
