1193.Monthly Transactions I
Explaination:

This MySQL query retrieves aggregated data from the `Transactions` table, grouping the results by month and country. Here's what each part of the query does:

1. `SUBSTR(trans_date, 1, 7) AS month`: This extracts the first 7 characters of the `trans_date` column, representing the year and month, and aliases it as `month`.
   
2. `country`: This column represents the country of the transaction.
   
3. `COUNT(id) AS trans_count`: This counts the number of transactions (`id` represents the transaction ID) for each month and country.
   
4. `SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count`: This calculates the count of approved transactions for each month and country using a conditional sum. If the state is 'approved', it adds 1, otherwise 0.
   
5. `SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount`: This calculates the total transaction amount for each month and country.
   
6. `SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount`: This calculates the total amount of approved transactions for each month and country. If the state is 'approved', it adds the amount, otherwise 0.

Finally, the `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `month` and `country`.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    SUBSTR(trans_date, 1, 7) AS month,
    country,
    COUNT(id) AS trans_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM
    Transactions
GROUP BY
    month,
    country;
```

This query provides a summary of transaction data aggregated by month and country, including transaction count, approved transaction count, total transaction amount, and total amount of approved transactions.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT  SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, count(id) as trans_count, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count, SUM(amount) as trans_total_amount, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END) as approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country
