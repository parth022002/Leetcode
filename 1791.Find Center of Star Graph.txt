1791.Find Center of Star Graph
Explanation:

The `findCenter` method is designed to find the center of a star graph. In a star graph, there is one central node connected to all other nodes, which each have only one connection.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Function Signature**: The method `findCenter` is part of a class `Solution` and it takes a parameter `edges` which is a list of lists. Each sublist represents an edge between two nodes in the graph.

2. **Edge Representation**: Each edge in the graph is represented by a list of two integers. For example, an edge `[a, b]` means there's an edge connecting node `a` and node `b`.

3. **Identifying the Center Node**: 
    - The center node in a star graph is the node that appears in all the edge pairs. Given that the graph is a star graph, the center node will appear in the first two edges.

4. **Checking the First Two Edges**: The method compares the nodes in the first two edges to find the common node, which will be the center of the star graph:
    - `edges[0][0] == edges[1][0]`: If the first node of the first edge is the same as the first node of the second edge, then this node is the center.
    - `edges[0][0] == edges[1][1]`: If the first node of the first edge is the same as the second node of the second edge, then this node is the center.
    - If neither of the above conditions is true, then the second node of the first edge must be the center.

5. **Return the Center Node**: Based on the checks above, the method returns the center node.

Here is the code again with comments:

```python
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Check if the first node of the first edge is the same as any node in the second edge
        if edges[0][0] == edges[1][0] or edges[0][0] == edges[1][1]:
            return edges[0][0]  # The first node of the first edge is the center
        # If the first node of the first edge is not the center, then the second node of the first edge must be the center
        return edges[0][1]
```

This method leverages the property of a star graph where the center node will appear in both of the first two edges. By comparing these nodes, the center node can be efficiently identified.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if edges[0][0] == edges[1][0] or edges[0][0] == edges[1][1]:
            return edges[0][0]
        return edges[0][1]
