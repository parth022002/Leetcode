85.Maximal Rectangle
Explanation:

This code seems to implement a solution to the "Maximal Rectangle" problem, which involves finding the largest rectangular area containing only 1s in a binary matrix. Let's break down the code:

- The `maximalRectangle` method takes a 2D list `matrix` representing the binary matrix as input and returns an integer representing the area of the largest rectangle.

- It first checks if the matrix is empty. If it is, it returns 0.

- It initializes variables `rows` and `cols` to store the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

- It initializes `max_area` to store the maximum area found so far.

- It iterates over each row in the matrix:
  - It initializes a `heights` array with zeros, where each element corresponds to the height of the rectangle ending at the current column in the current row.
  - It calculates the heights of rectangles for the current row based on consecutive '1's using a dynamic programming approach.
  
- Within the loop over each row:
  - It uses a stack-based approach to calculate the maximum area. It iterates over each column index:
    - If the current height (`heights[i]`) is less than the height of the previous column (`heights[stack[-1]]`), it pops the index from the stack and calculates the area.
    - It updates `max_area` if the calculated area is greater than the current maximum.
    - Finally, it appends the current column index to the stack.

- After the loop, it handles the case where the stack is not empty, calculating areas for the remaining indices.

- It returns `max_area`, which holds the maximum area found.

This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum area of a rectangle containing only 1s in the binary matrix.

    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not matrix:
            return 0
        
        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        max_area = 0
        
        for row in matrix:
            heights = [0] * cols  # Initialize heights array with zeros
            
            for i in range(cols):
                heights[i] = heights[i] + 1 if row[i] == '1' else 0
            
            # Calculate max area using stack
            stack = []
            for i in range(cols):
                while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]:
                    height = heights[stack.pop()]
                    width = i - stack[-1] if stack else i
                    area = height * width
                    max_area = max(max_area, area)
                stack.append(i)
                
            # Handle the case where the stack is not empty
            while stack:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]
                width = cols - stack[-1] if stack else cols
                area = height * width
                max_area = max(max_area, area)

        return max_area
