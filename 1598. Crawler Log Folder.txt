1598. Crawler Log Folder
Solution:

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, logs: List[str]) -> int:
        depth = 0
        for log in logs:
            if log == "../":
                depth -= 1 if depth > 0 else 0
            elif log == "./":
                depth += 0
            else:
                depth += 1
        return depth

Explanation:

Sure! Let's break down your `minOperations` function step-by-step:

### Purpose of the Function
The function `minOperations` is designed to determine the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder (root directory) from a series of operations logged in a list. Each operation represents a file system command that either moves up a directory, stays in the current directory, or moves into a subdirectory.

### Input
- `logs`: A list of strings where each string represents an operation. The operations can be:
  - `"../"`: Move up one directory.
  - `"./"`: Stay in the current directory.
  - Any other string (representing a subdirectory name): Move into that subdirectory.

### Output
- An integer representing the minimum number of operations to return to the root directory.

### Function Breakdown
1. **Initialize `depth`**:
   - `depth = 0`
   - This variable keeps track of the current depth in the directory structure. Starting from the root directory, the initial depth is 0.

2. **Iterate Through `logs`**:
   - `for log in logs:`
   - This loop goes through each operation in the `logs` list.

3. **Handle Different Operations**:
   - **Move Up One Directory**:
     - `if log == "../":`
     - If the operation is `"../"`, check if the current depth is greater than 0.
     - `depth -= 1 if depth > 0 else 0`
     - If the depth is greater than 0, decrease it by 1 (move up one directory). If the depth is 0, do nothing (cannot go up from root).
   - **Stay in the Current Directory**:
     - `elif log == "./":`
     - If the operation is `"./"`, do nothing.
     - `depth += 0`
     - This line effectively does nothing since adding 0 does not change the depth.
   - **Move Into a Subdirectory**:
     - `else:`
     - For any other operation (which represents moving into a subdirectory), increase the depth by 1.
     - `depth += 1`

4. **Return the Result**:
   - `return depth`
   - After processing all the operations, the function returns the final value of `depth`, which represents the number of subdirectory levels deep from the root directory.

### Example
Let's go through an example to see how it works:

**Input**:
```python
logs = ["d1/", "d2/", "../", "d21/", "./"]
```

**Execution**:
- `depth = 0`
- `"d1/"`: `depth` becomes 1 (move into `d1`)
- `"d2/"`: `depth` becomes 2 (move into `d2` inside `d1`)
- `"../"`: `depth` becomes 1 (move up from `d2` to `d1`)
- `"d21/"`: `depth` becomes 2 (move into `d21` inside `d1`)
- `"./"`: `depth` remains 2 (stay in `d21`)

**Output**:
- The function returns `2`, which is the number of operations needed to go back to the root directory from the current position.

This implementation ensures that the depth is always non-negative and properly reflects the current directory level after processing each operation.
