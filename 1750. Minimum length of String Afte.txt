1750. Minimum length of String After Deleting Similar Ends

Explaination:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minimumLength` that calculates the minimum possible length of a non-empty string `s` after performing zero or more operations.

Here's how the code works:

1. It initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to the beginning and end of the string `s`, respectively.

2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `l` is less than `r` and the characters at positions `l` and `r` are the same. This loop is intended to handle cases where the string has leading and trailing characters that are the same.

3. Inside this loop:
   - It retrieves the character `c` at position `l`, assuming that `s[l]` is equal to `s[r]`.
   - It increments `l` until it finds a character different from `c` or until `l` becomes greater than or equal to `r`.
   - It decrements `r` until it finds a character different from `c` or until `r` becomes less than or equal to `l`.

4. After exiting the loop, it returns the length of the substring of `s` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive. This represents the minimum possible length of `s` after performing the operations.

This code efficiently handles cases where the string `s` has leading and trailing characters that are the same, finding the minimum possible length by removing these characters. The correction made to the loop ensures that `l` and `r` are updated properly after finding the character `c`, ensuring correctness in determining the minimum length of the substring.
Solution:

class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

        while l < r and s[l] == s[r]:
            c = s[l]

            while l <= r and s[l] == c:
                l +=1
            
            while r > l and s[r] ==c:
                r -= 1

        return r - l + 1
