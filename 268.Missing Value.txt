268.Missing Value
Explanation:

This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `missingNumber`. This method takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the missing number in the sequence `[0, 1, 2, ..., n]`, where `n` is the length of the list `nums`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. `n = len(nums)`: It calculates the length of the input list `nums`.

2. `Tsum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2`: It calculates the sum of numbers from `0` to `n` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This is the expected sum if all numbers from `0` to `n` were present in the list.

3. `actual_sum = sum(nums)`: It calculates the sum of all elements present in the list `nums`.

4. `return Tsum - actual_sum`: It returns the difference between the expected sum (`Tsum`) and the actual sum (`actual_sum`). This difference represents the missing number in the sequence.

Overall, the method efficiently finds the missing number in the sequence `[0, 1, 2, ..., n]` by calculating the expected sum of the sequence and subtracting the sum of elements present in the list `nums`. The result is the missing number.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        Tsum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
        actual_sum = sum(nums)
        return Tsum - actual_sum
